00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,960
'HARIKRISHNANS'

2
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,600
God bless you!
Have a nice vacation.

3
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,560
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

4
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,640
Should I write it as
Guptan or Guptadev?

5
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,320
I wouldn't mind
even if you write it as G.

6
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,560
I shall write it as Guptan.

7
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,120
Guptan, care of Mira, Hill Garden.
- Okay.

8
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,800
Thank you
for helping me check in here!

9
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,320
Please take him to the room.

10
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,040
I'm leaving.

11
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,400
When will I see you next?

12
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,400
I'll call you.
I'll visit you as well.

13
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,960
I'm really looking forward
to meeting that special person.

14
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,840
Did you travel
all by yourself, Ammalu?

15
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,840
Of course.

16
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,920
Brother will send me on a solo
world tour next year. - Oh, God!

17
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,800
Mr. Jose, this is Ammalu, the
one we told you about.

18
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,600
I see. They have told me
everything about you.

19
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,360
Though you're 11, you have the IQ
of a 20-year-old.

20
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,560
The topper of your class!

21
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,080
Exceptional in games
and sports as well!

22
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,800
One of the best
students of your school!

23
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,200
They told me

24
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,200
that you'd be here
for ten days to visit the place.

25
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,520
Roam around all you want.

26
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,080
But don't run into Gabriel.
Be careful!

27
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,560
He is a cannibal!

28
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,920
He is so strong that he could
take on ten men at once.

29
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,280
He is short-tempered.

30
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,280
He captures children, takes them
into the forest and eats them!

31
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,520
Please don't make a lot of noise.

32
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,440
He might climb
over the wall and come here.

33
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,640
Oh!

34
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,600
Aunt!

35
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,320
Uncle!

36
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,400
Mira is here!

37
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,960
What were you thinking, Mira?

38
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,960
Why did you travel almost
300 km all by yourself?

39
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,480
I'm not a kid anymore.

40
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,600
That's exactly my point.

41
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,920
You should be careful
now that you're an adult.

42
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,600
Wouldn't it hurt my pride
if you travel alone?

43
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,040
Why did you travel by bus, Mira?
Why didn't you give us a call?

44
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,440
Dad.. - Yes.
- Please explain it to mom.

45
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,920
Okay.
- There is nothing to explain.

46
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,080
Aunt, let me make it clear
that I don't approve of it.

47
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,960
Neither do I.
- What?

48
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,920
Hello. - How is it going?
Did you like the room?

49
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,120
Oh, it's you, Mira.
It's excellent.

50
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,960
When should we meet?

51
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,360
I'm good anytime.

52
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,440
Okay, I'll be there in the evening.
- Sure. - Bye.

53
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,840
"Oh, wind! Did you see those
ripe mangoes on those groves?"

54
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,960
"Could we swing on those lovely
vines? Does it have tender leaves?"

55
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,240
"Oh, dark cloud! You wear
bangles made of lightning."

56
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:56,160
"You swing on the rainbow.
Please come to me!"

57
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,600
"Come to me and let's fly
in the night sky"

58
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,200
"in search
of the lustrous moonlight."

59
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,480
"We've a beautiful
garden in the blue sky!"

60
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,920
"And we have a wonderful
home near a valley."

61
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,400
"A playhouse
that is filled with jubilation."

62
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,560
"Oh, dark cloud! You wear
bangles made of lightning."

63
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,720
"You swing on the rainbow.
Please come to me!"

64
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,000
"Come to me and let's fly
in the night sky"

65
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,640
"in search
of the lustrous moonlight."

66
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,800
"Once you've reached me, please
don't leave me anytime soon."

67
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,200
"Please don't vanish
far away. - Please don't."

68
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,560
"Please don't shed tears
when you feel resentment."

69
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,400
"Don't fade away without talking
to me. - Please don't disappear."

70
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,680
"You have the beautiful moonlight
for company. - The moonlight!"

71
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,960
"You have vivid dreams.
- Dreams!"

72
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,080
"And the melodious song
of the birds"

73
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:40,160
"echoes on those hills
adorned by sandalwood trees."

74
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:44,040
"On those hills adorned
by sandalwood trees."

75
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,960
Gabriel! - Oh, no! - Oh, my God!
- Run! - Ammalu, come on!

76
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,160
Okay.

77
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,840
Dress the wound and give her
an injection. - Yes, doctor.

78
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,280
Gabriel!

79
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,800
Escape!
- Run..

80
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,600
Come here.

81
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,320
Okay.
Thank you very much.

82
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,080
Bye.

83
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,400
Gabriel is not bad at all.

84
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,920
He is an innocent man.

85
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,120
He is deaf and dumb.

86
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,360
Mr. Jose, why do you spread
such rumours about Gabriel?

87
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,600
He is innocent.
But he can get scary at times.

88
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,360
Nonsense!
You know nothing at all.

89
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,640
What are you up to, Mira?

90
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,880
Kunjikuttan would not tell these
without a valid reason.

91
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,920
Whom do you meet at the hotel?

92
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,960
Hey, this is not America.

93
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,480
How can you roam around
with a man so freely?

94
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,120
I have tolerated enough.
Make it clear now!

95
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,800
Who is that fellow?

96
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,240
Why are you staring at me?
I am serious.

97
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,920
You can't do things as you wish!

98
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,920
Can I join you for a few days?

99
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,560
Of course.
Please come.

100
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,720
Hey!

101
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,080
Yes, I came on a bicycle.

102
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,240
If we call you
for a dinner party tonight

103
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,720
will you come?

104
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,000
Everyone wants to meet you.

105
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,480
Are you staying here alone?

106
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,160
Don't you have any relatives?

107
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,480
Who are they?

108
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,920
Where are they now?

109
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,880
Are they gone?
- Yes.

110
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,120
'If your daughter were alive,
she would have been my age.'

111
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,520
Hi. - I am Vishwambharan,
Mira's dad. - Oh.

112
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,520
I am Guptan.

113
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,320
Mira has told me everything.

114
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,120
She had a fight with her mom.
- She told me.

115
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,240
Your mom won't understand you
the way I do.

116
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,800
She is upset.
Come and pacify her.

117
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,960
I was about to come anyway.
- Then come along.

118
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,840
It was nice meeting you.

119
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,160
See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

120
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,160
Bye.
- Okay.

121
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,000
Please sit down.

122
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,880
"I have invited you to my house."

123
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,080
"What will you present me
in return, friend?"

124
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,200
"I will serve you food with love."

125
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,400
"Do relish it without hesitating,
friend!"

126
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,520
"I have hot rice for you.
- I have hot rice for you.."

127
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,720
"I have tasty gravy for you.
- I have tasty gravy for you.."

128
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,960
"You can enjoy the scenery here.."

129
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,920
"The lovely and beautiful scenery."

130
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,200
"Oh, dark cloud! You wear
bangles made of lightning."

131
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,640
"You swing on the rainbow.
Please come to me!"

132
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,520
"Come to me and let's fly
in the night sky"

133
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,320
"in search
of the lustrous moonlight."

134
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,360
That dumb Gabriel killed him
with a pickaxe.

135
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,280
'Dumb man arrested for murder
in Poonoor.'

136
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,840
No. Gabriel is not the killer.

137
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,240
It was not Gabriel!

138
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,200
'Smoking is injurious to health.'

139
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,760
Look, according to the post-mortem
report, the murder

140
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,160
happened between 10 p.m.
and 10.30 p.m. yesterday.

141
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,440
But Gabriel was with us
until midnight.

142
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,320
Then how is it possible?

143
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,360
We had invited Gabriel.

144
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,880
He had his dinner with us.
- Come here, dear.

145
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,800
Don't tell this to anyone.
- But..

146
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,520
Just forget about all this.
Okay?

147
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,920
But I am telling the truth.

148
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,600
Otherwise, you can ask them.

149
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,160
Dear, have you heard
of Mr. Vishwambharan?

150
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,200
He is the one who decides
everything here.

151
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,160
Going against him is just
inviting trouble.

152
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,800
Then we won't be there
to help you out.

153
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,120
No need.
I don't need anyone.

154
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,760
I will handle this myself.

155
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,200
I can also approach
Harikrishnan Associates.

156
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,360
Hey, don't push.
- Just move.

157
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,440
He is there.
- Come on!

158
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,680
Don't push.
Just let me through. - Hey!

159
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,000
Hey! - Sir..

160
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,400
Sir, what happened to the appeal
in the Kozhikode case?

161
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,280
Move..
I want to say something.

162
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,120
Sir, what is the status of the
Karunagappally case?

163
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,680
What are you saying?
Move aside!

164
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,360
I am a relative
of the judicial magistrate.

165
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,240
What happened to my case? - I'll
tell the magistrate to hang you.

166
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,840
Haven't I told you

167
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,240
to come to the office for queries?
Leave me!

168
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,880
Are the Harikrishnans inside?

169
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,040
Yes. They have arrived.

170
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,240
They are discussing a case.

171
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,640
Any woman would be scared
if her husband

172
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,320
comes home at night stealthily
like a thief.

173
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,160
When the wife started screaming
when he snatched her jewellery

174
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,680
the husband killed her ruthlessly.

175
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,840
Any wife will be afraid
when her husband

176
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,920
finds her lover hiding in her room.

177
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,160
Amidst the fight between the men

178
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,760
the wife was thrashed

179
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,600
and killed by mistake
while trying to help her lover.

180
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,840
She would have been killed
by her own lover!

181
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,000
Since there is not even a doubt
about the existence of such a lover

182
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,880
this argument can never be given
consideration.

183
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,600
Yes. But they can try all
possible ways.

184
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,840
But will this work out here,
Krishnan? - No way, Hari.

185
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,120
Then you can come down.

186
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,280
The only defence that the defendant
can bring out in this case

187
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,960
is to create an imaginary
lover. But it won't last.

188
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,800
So, Harikrishnan Associates can
take up this case.

189
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,400
Do not miss any of his points.

190
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,960
Let Simon take up this case.
- Okay.

191
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,320
The rascal who killed his wife
for gold

192
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,040
should get the maximum punishment.
- Yes, sir.

193
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,240
Take it as a challenge.
- Where is Mr. Sundaran?

194
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,560
I am here!
I am here itself..

195
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,840
Where were you until now?

196
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,440
I've been here a while.

197
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,600
But those idiots stopped me
at the entrance itself.

198
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,360
I didn't want to create a scene,
so.. - Enough.

199
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,080
We are leaving.
- You can come later. - Okay.

200
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,600
Who was the prosecutor?
- Mr. Hari.

201
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,040
Mr. Krishnan was defending.

202
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,960
Have you made a note of all
the points? - Yes.

203
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,360
Ammalu is calling from Poonoor!

204
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,080
Ammalu is calling!
- Sir..

205
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,520
Sir, what about my case?
- Move..

206
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,320
Hari here, Ammalu.
- Krishnan here. - What is it?

207
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,960
What? You want us to come there?
- Why, dear?

208
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,520
What is the matter?

209
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,160
Hey, we are busy here.

210
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,080
Is it important?

211
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,080
Okay, then. We are there.

212
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,280
Harikrishnan Associates
is an all India network

213
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,480
consisting of around 300 advocates.

214
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,680
Usually, they let their juniors

215
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,400
handle most of the cases.

216
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,800
But we don't have to get worried

217
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,680
if they are taking up
this case in person.

218
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,800
They will submit a bail petition

219
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,360
question the kids
who are the witnesses

220
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,760
and will then get bail.

221
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,640
Which means.. Harikrishnans have
taken up this case.

222
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,800
So we don't have to worry
about it anymore.

223
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,600
What the hell are you saying?

224
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,440
We have to confront Harikrishnans!
How can we take that lightly?

225
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,040
You see, Mr. Kunjikuttan.

226
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,680
Aren't they here to prove
that Gabriel is innocent?

227
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,040
And not to bring the actual
culprit before the law.

228
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,760
They would leave once
they have done their job.

229
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,960
Will they? Are you sure?
- They will leave.

230
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,560
However, if you learn that
they backed out of a case

231
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,760
that would mean that the game
has changed. You must be careful.

232
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,040
It means that they would leave
only once it is proven.

233
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,160
In the sense,
they would leave only

234
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,720
by ensuring that the culprit
is punished by the law.

235
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,120
In order to do so, they
have their own detective agency.

236
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,560
Yes.

237
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,680
Your Honour, I am Harikrishnan
from Harikrishnan Associates.

238
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,400
We appear for the accused.

239
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,840
Your Honour, I am also Harikrishnan
from Harikrishnan Associates.

240
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,680
I know.
Harikrishnans.

241
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,760
Yes. He is Harikrishnan,
and I am Harikrishnan.

242
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,200
I call him Hari,
and he calls me Krishnan.

243
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,960
And together we are Harikrishnan
of Harikrishnan Associates.

244
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,160
Okay. Proceed.

245
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,520
What is your name?
- Nisha.

246
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,320
Okay.
Do you know that man?

247
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,360
No.

248
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,560
Didn't all of you
throw him a party?

249
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,880
No.

250
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,480
Didn't he buy you
chocolates that day? - No.

251
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,640
Who gave you instructions
for these responses? Mom or dad?

252
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,480
Dad and mom.

253
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,640
You may leave.

254
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,120
Your Honour.

255
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,240
Gabriel and the kids were at a
party during the time of murder.

256
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,040
However, none of the kids' parents
are letting them speak the truth.

257
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,080
It is evident that someone
is behind this.

258
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,680
Hence, by taking Nisha's statements
into account as evidence, I request

259
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,960
the court to grant Gabriel
bail until further progress.

260
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,240
That is all, your Honour.

261
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,960
Yes.

262
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,360
Your Honour.

263
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,320
I would like to question
someone before the court

264
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,080
before granting
the accused with bail.

265
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,840
Who is that?
- Ammalu.

266
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,040
How long has it been since
you have arrived at Poonoor?

267
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,040
One week.
- Okay.

268
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,440
How are you related
to the Harikrishnans?

269
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,880
Hari is my brother.

270
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,560
They say that despite her age, she
has the maturity of a 21-year-old.

271
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,960
Who has said so?

272
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,040
My class teacher, principal
and many more. - Okay.

273
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,000
How much were you graded
in the subject English?

274
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,800
100 percent.
- Very good.

275
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,360
In that case,
I have a doubt.

276
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,960
Will you clarify it for me?
- Yes.

277
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,680
What is the difference
between love and like?

278
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,880
I love my brother.
- Okay.

279
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,520
And I like ice cream.

280
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,720
Do you love him or like him?

281
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,560
Do you love him or like him?

282
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,640
I love him.

283
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,600
What kind of love?

284
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,320
What kind of love?

285
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,640
Love.
That's all.

286
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,080
Did you go over to Gabriel's place?

287
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,160
Yes.

288
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,640
Did you enter his room?
- Yes.

289
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,600
Were there anybody
else at his place? - No.

290
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,920
Did he leave the door open
or lock it from inside?

291
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,320
He locked it from inside.

292
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,760
Did Gabriel touch you?

293
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,240
Did Gabriel touch you?

294
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,560
Yes.
- Where did he touch you?

295
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,440
He first touched my cheek..
- And?

296
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,960
What did he do to you?
Did he take you in his arms?

297
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,200
Did he hug you?
Come on, tell me!

298
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,480
He hugged me.
- Okay.

299
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,560
If an 11-year-old has the
maturity of a 21-year-old

300
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,880
it is certain that she would
have the feelings of a 21-year-old.

301
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,720
I state before the court

302
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,600
that there exists an illicit
relationship between Gabriel

303
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,880
and the child that doesn't
comply with society's notions.

304
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,120
Also, I state that
the brilliant mind

305
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,280
such as Ammalu is
Harikrishnan's solution

306
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,120
to bail their client.

307
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,040
She is a liar
before the law.

308
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:12,040
Your Honour, if we bail
an accused for the sake

309
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,000
of a child, that will only..

310
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,920
Let me go..
- Please don't.

311
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,920
It is unfair that he doesn't
let a lawyer plead his case.

312
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:23,120
Get lost. Take him.
- Get here! - Take him!

313
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,880
Get off me. - Let him go.
- No!

314
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,720
No, Hari. Let's go.
Let's leave, Krishna.

315
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,480
Take him.

316
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,480
Please drop the case.
Let us leave.

317
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,800
Take him.
- Keep walking.

318
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,520
Let us leave.
Let us go.

319
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,560
Your Honour.

320
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,560
We are backing out of this case.

321
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,960
They backed out?

322
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,400
What does that mean?

323
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,640
Lawyer!
Am I going to be screwed?

324
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,720
If the Harikrishnans have backed
out from a case

325
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,400
it doesn't comply only one,
but has many meanings to it.

326
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,960
The first being that they have
set for something even bigger.

327
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,120
Can you look at my
face while you speak?

328
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,240
And the second being that they are
going to open an office for it.

329
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,840
And the third being that they
won't rest until this case is over.

330
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,520
Which means..
- Which means I am screwed.

331
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,440
...that is the fourth meaning.
- What?

332
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:31,440
Why didn't you want us to
proceed with the case, Ammalu?

333
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,840
The case is only beginning,
isn't it?

334
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:39,040
Just consider that Ammalu

335
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,560
helped us find
and bring a dangerous man

336
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,200
before the law,
who was in hiding all the while.

337
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,320
We would leave only once
the case is settled.

338
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,080
Really?
- Yes.

339
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:04,600
"Oh, beautiful moon.
A thousand.."

340
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:10,600
"Oh, beautiful moon.
A thousand eyes gaze at you."

341
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:16,400
"Oh, the treasure of heaven!
Come to the sky."

342
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,640
"We'll steal that melodious song"

343
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,120
"of the cuckoo's lips for you."

344
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,280
"We'll let you witness the shining
light of a thousand lamps."

345
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,320
"The dark clouds
will adorn your soft cheeks."

346
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:37,560
"Oh, beautiful moon.
A thousand eyes gaze at you."

347
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:43,360
"Oh, the treasure of heaven!
Come to the sky."

348
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,640
"We'll steal that melodious song"

349
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:51,240
"of the cuckoo's lips for you."

350
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,280
"We'll let you witness the shining
light of a thousand lamps."

351
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,160
"The dark clouds
will adorn your soft cheeks."

352
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,880
"Even though you are silent now,
we know you love to converse."

353
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,720
"It is so pleasing
to listen to your beautiful voice."

354
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,640
"Oh, dragonfly! Your lips"

355
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:58,400
"have the fragrance
of a beautiful flower."

356
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,320
"Oh, glowworm. You have
the whole night for yourself"

357
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,080
"and the dazzling
moonlight for company."

358
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:11,680
"Oh, beautiful moon.
A thousand eyes gaze at you."

359
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:17,520
"Oh, the treasure of heaven!
Come to the sky."

360
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,320
"The mischievous kitten
and its playmates"

361
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:56,000
"winked at you as they wanted
to make friends with you."

362
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,120
"The crow sang a song,
and it wants to whisper"

363
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:05,680
"something in your ears
about your marriage."

364
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,280
"No, you shouldn't
go anywhere."

365
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,120
"This beautiful child is ours."

366
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:18,880
"Oh, beautiful moon.
A thousand eyes gaze at you."

367
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,760
"Oh, the treasure of heaven!
Come to the sky."

368
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,920
"We'll steal that melodious song"

369
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,640
"of the cuckoo's lips for you."

370
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,560
"We'll let you witness the shining
light of a thousand lamps."

371
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,520
"The dark clouds
will adorn your soft cheeks."

372
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,120
"Better than the
entire world"

373
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:49,400
"is our India."

374
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,960
"Better than the
entire world.."

375
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,200
"We are its nightingales"

376
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:03,160
"and it is our garden abode."

377
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,080
The precision of the murders
committed by Vishwambharan.

378
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,080
He has been involved in 12 murders
in the past 24 years.

379
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,560
All 12 of them have been
done with such perfection.

380
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,120
Each one of them has
an Hitchcockian style.

381
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,360
Hitchcock?
I didn't sign?

382
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,640
What do you mean by
Hitchcockian style?

383
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,560
It means that the culprit
could be found right away.

384
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,520
Just like he showed Gabriel
to us as the culprit.

385
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,880
So the story goes like this.

386
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,960
Vishwambharan's daughter Mira

387
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,800
comes here, accompanied
by her lover Guptan.

388
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,120
The two lovers roam
around the village.

389
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,680
Vishwambharan was not at all
interested in this relationship.

390
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,960
He tried opposing it many times
but wasn't successful.

391
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:01,320
Mira had even slept
with Guptan at a hotel room.

392
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,520
Is it?
When did that happen?

393
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,920
On the night of November 26.

394
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,720
Mr. Vishwambharan, who
couldn't take this anymore

395
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,800
decided to kill Guptan
and put the blame on the deaf-mute.

396
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:19,680
So, Vishwambharan is not
destroying any of the evidence.

397
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,680
Instead, he is intentionally
giving us all the evidence.

398
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,960
Still, against whom should
we use that pickaxe

399
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,400
which was used as an
important evidence

400
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,560
in trying to prove that
Gabriel was the culprit?

401
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,680
We should place that pickaxe
on Vishwambharan's hands.

402
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,000
It would perfectly
match his hands.

403
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,200
Was there any need to come here

404
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,640
and open an office
for such a silly case?

405
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,160
This case is really a simple
and straightforward one.

406
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,280
Somebody tries to kill
Guptan in his hotel room

407
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,240
by injecting a
poisonous substance

408
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,600
which even our lab
couldn't identify until now.

409
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,760
Then throws him down
from the third floor

410
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,960
and finally stabs him using
a pickaxe. It's as simple as that.

411
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,840
It becomes even simpler when we've
a post-mortem report that couldn't

412
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,560
specify if the death happened
because of the poison

413
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,240
or being stabbed or by falling
from the third floor.

414
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,360
Also, we have
a useless investigation report.

415
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,480
It's as simple as that.

416
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,280
What do you have to say about Mira?

417
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,240
Her character is a bit confusing.

418
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,160
She strongly testified
against Gabriel at the court

419
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,400
even after knowing that
her dad was behind this.

420
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,480
Vishwambharan might
have threatened her.

421
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,120
Shouldn't we meet her, Hari?
- Yes.

422
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,080
She refuses to meet us whenever
we ask for an appointment.

423
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,280
Doesn't she visit
anyone or anywhere?

424
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,800
There is a place she visits
every evening.

425
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,160
A British library.

426
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,320
So, we are meeting
her today. Aren't we?

427
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,680
Hari, we are being followed

428
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,320
by that car for a long time.

429
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,920
Give them room.
Let them go ahead.

430
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,440
They are not passing us.

431
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,720
Somebody isn't happy
with us meeting her.

432
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,600
They would've decided to leave
us as we are two simple lawyers.

433
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,360
Mira.
- Mira.

434
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,320
Good morning, Mira.
- Good morning.

435
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,360
We are..
- Harikrishnans.

436
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,280
So you know us.

437
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,200
But you might be confused about

438
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,800
who is Hari and who
is Krishnan among us.

439
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:02,280
So don't get confused. I'm Hari.
I'm Krishnan.

440
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,080
So let's come to the
matter, shall we? - Yes.

441
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,720
Come on.

442
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,720
We are aware that this
is a moment of grief for you.

443
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,080
Unfortunately, we are also involved

444
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,520
in the same case which
saddens you. - Yes.

445
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:19,320
To make matters worse,
we are appearing

446
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,200
as the defence lawyers
in the court. - Exactly.

447
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,720
To start with,
we first met that deaf-mute

448
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,440
whom your dad blames
for the murder. - Yes.

449
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,080
We asked him everything.

450
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,440
He is innocent.

451
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,240
Even you are aware of it.

452
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:38,360
Not just you, even your dad
and everyone else is aware of it.

453
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,760
Then for whom is he getting
tortured like this?

454
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,640
You should give us an answer.

455
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,280
I want to ask you
the same thing.

456
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,160
For whom did he take
the blame upon himself?

457
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,240
Who forced him to do all this?

458
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,360
I want to know it, too.

459
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,920
You might think that my
dad is behind all this.

460
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,760
I would've believed you if you had
told me about it a long time back.

461
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,840
I grew up, seeing my dad
do all kinds of illegal things.

462
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,320
It made me question
everything in life.

463
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,960
For the past seven-eight years

464
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,840
I'm sure that my dad
hasn't done anything wrong.

465
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,120
It was I who influenced
the public prosecutor.

466
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,760
So, even after knowing
that he is innocent

467
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,080
for whom did you insult that
poor little girl in the court..

468
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,880
And tried to reject the bail

469
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,600
of a deaf..
- And dumb person?

470
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,000
For what reason?

471
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,800
I-I didn't think that the public
prosecutor would do all this.

472
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:45,960
I'm sorry for that.

473
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:52,400
Gabriel should be in jail
until we catch the real culprit.

474
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,080
It is necessary for me.

475
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,960
So you know who
is behind the murder.

476
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,120
We don't understand why
you are trying to hide

477
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,400
the guy who is behind
the murder of your lover.

478
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,880
There are many things
that you wouldn't understand.

479
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,600
Why should I tell you,
the defence lawyers?

480
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,480
We are on opposite
sides in this case.

481
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,600
Don't forget that
while asking your questions.

482
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,840
Krishnan. - Yes?
- It's very confusing.

483
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,720
One thing is for sure.
- What?

484
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,520
We can remove Vishwambharan
from the list. - For sure.

485
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,800
He is not involved in this case.

486
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,040
But this Mira..

487
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,640
She is mysterious.
- Yes.

488
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,760
Ammalu has entrusted us
with a very tricky case.

489
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,760
Together, we will walk upon
the path filled with mysteries.

490
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,680
Hari.
- Krishnan.

491
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:02,320
Yes, we got it.

492
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,240
We found two old cases in which
Vishwambharan was involved.

493
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,320
To hell with it.
Throw it away.

494
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,960
We don't require it anymore.

495
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:15,280
He is now transforming
himself into a Gandhian.

496
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,240
Discard this file
and start a new one.

497
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,960
Whose?
- Guptan's.

498
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,600
Guptan, the one who is dead?

499
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,880
We are not able to find the details

500
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,960
of the living,
let alone this dead guy.

501
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,560
We have to find it immediately.

502
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,840
Harikrishnans Associates!

503
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,960
Networks all over India!

504
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,360
And yet, nobody could find
any details about Guptan.

505
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,760
There is absolutely no information!

506
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,720
Nonsense!

507
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,360
Did he fall from the sky?

508
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,840
We received the specimen
re-examination report from Delhi.

509
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,160
They couldn't identify the
details about the poison yet.

510
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,200
Not yet?
- No.

511
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,560
Where is this case heading to?

512
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,560
Did you tell Hari?
- Yes.

513
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,400
It seems that Guptan doesn't
belong to this planet.

514
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,440
It seems that he came
from some other planet.

515
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,240
Did you inquire about Mira's
cousin, Mr. Kunjikuttan?

516
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,160
He is good for nothing.
Should we inquire about him?

517
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,560
No, leave him alone for now.

518
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,400
He might send for us.

519
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,240
But Guptan.. - We cannot even
find his address.

520
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,360
It's Guptan, care of Mira
at the police station.

521
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,000
It's Guptan, care of Mira
at the hotel.

522
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,880
It's Guptan, care of Mira
even in the post-mortem report.

523
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,600
Only while receiving his body,
it's written as Mira.

524
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,960
What could be a solution for this?

525
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,960
How many ambulances would
be there in Poonoor?

526
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,720
I didn't think in that way.

527
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,520
Now you have to start
thinking in that way.

528
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,640
Who are you?
- Are you an ambulance driver?

529
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,840
Antony, right?
- Yes.

530
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,640
Guptan's body was
taken in your ambulance

531
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,240
after the post-mortem
on the 27th of last month.

532
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,120
I don't know anyone called Guptan.

533
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,840
We have lots of work
to do after this.

534
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,040
Try to remember.

535
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,800
I deal with dead bodies every day.

536
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,880
I never remember these things.

537
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,680
Now, just try to remember it.

538
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,560
Yes, try to remember.
Just think about it.

539
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,080
Come on, Antony.
Tell us.

540
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,680
Tell us.
- Yes, I will.

541
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,640
Mira had told me to keep it
as a secret. - That's okay.

542
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,280
I took it to a place
200 km away from here.

543
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,160
Where?

544
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,160
To the Killikal palace.

545
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,560
Killikal palace.

546
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,240
"Magical palace."

547
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,200
Oh, God!

548
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,320
Who are you?
- We are Guptan's..

549
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,440
Why are you

550
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,680
trying to scare us?

551
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:03,920
I was scared.

552
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,720
We are advocates
enquiring about Guptan.

553
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,200
Who lives here?

554
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,360
Myself, my Lord and a servant.
That's all.

555
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,360
So are you the youngest of the lot?

556
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,240
In a way. - So are you
not directly related? - No.

557
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,880
So let the Lord know that two
advocates are here to meet him.

558
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,600
'This magnificent evening.'

559
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,120
Hari.
- Yes?

560
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,240
'This magnificent evening.'

561
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,320
Keep it..

562
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,280
What is it now?

563
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,440
Who are you?

564
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,120
Why do you want to meet me?

565
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,200
They want to ask the same
questions and hurt me. That's all.

566
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,440
What's the use in talking now?

567
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,560
Can you give my Guptan back to me?

568
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,800
Can you?

569
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,280
The ones who murdered
my innocent son

570
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,160
are freely walking the streets.

571
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,040
Can you get them to me alive?

572
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,640
You may talk to me after that.

573
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,680
Can you?

574
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,200
We will present

575
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,480
whoever is responsible
for your son's death

576
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,720
at your feet

577
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,280
within ten days.

578
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,440
What is it, Hari?
Why are you giving him hope?

579
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,440
Fine..

580
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:35,800
Forgive me if I was rude.

581
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,320
You did not mention your names.

582
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,280
My name is Harikrishnan.
- Okay.

583
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,320
I am also Harikrishnan.

584
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,360
What is this?

585
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,480
This is nice.

586
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,480
You are both renowned advocates.

587
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,160
Is it the two of you?
- Yes..

588
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,600
Why didn't you mention that?

589
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,720
This is Ramappan.

590
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,240
He is a distant relative
from my mother's side.

591
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,000
He has two children in Chennai.
One among them is a doctor.

592
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,360
They are here on learning
of Guptan's demise.

593
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,560
All of them grew up together.

594
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,200
As Guptan was crazy
about travelling

595
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,640
Ramappan and his kids
gave me company.

596
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,440
What do you want to know?
Ask me.

597
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,320
We wanted to be familiar
with Guptan's life.

598
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,960
We also wanted to know what
you had to say about him.

599
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,600
We got a few hints on our way here.

600
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,600
We came to know that
he was an introvert

601
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,760
and a very talented person.

602
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,520
We came to know that he sang well.

603
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,880
What are you saying?

604
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,800
He just had to touch the Veena.

605
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,560
He would create divine music.

606
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,400
He was a poet, a singer

607
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,320
a scholar and much more.

608
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,960
Didn't you notice
the decorations outside?

609
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,400
Today is the festival of lights.

610
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,760
The festival at the temple
also starts today.

611
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,680
This will be a festival
without my son for the first time.

612
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,560
After the lamps are lit,
and the festival is started

613
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,880
venerations for the Goddess
will be performed for nine days.

614
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,920
The Goddess will be pleased by
singing songs on the tenth day

615
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
and will be welcomed to our
home from the temple.

616
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,200
My Guptan did that.

617
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,040
My son would stand in front

618
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,320
of the Goddess.

619
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,840
I would bathe

620
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,400
and bless him wholeheartedly.

621
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,360
As the rightful heir of the house

622
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,720
he will let go of everything

623
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:23,240
including wealth
and power and become pure.

624
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,600
He will become a nomad.

625
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:28,680
The Goddess, pleased
by music and lights

626
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,360
would permit us
to live for a year

627
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,240
and return after
giving back the wealth.

628
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,640
That is the custom here.

629
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,760
Guptan had accepted the wealth

630
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,480
and sang songs for the Goddess

631
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,640
for the past 20 years.

632
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,520
On the night of the tenth day
this year

633
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,280
who is there to please
the Goddess with music?

634
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:59,000
Whom shall I bless
as per tradition?

635
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,760
Who will accept the wealth
from the Goddess?

636
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,520
Please don't worry, your Majesty.

637
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,760
Guptan will come back.

638
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,800
What are you saying?

639
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:17,120
He said that he would bring
the one who murdered Guptan.

640
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,840
Now you say that Guptan
will come back.

641
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,000
Let him come.

642
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,480
Even I want the same

643
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,360
in my heart.

644
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,200
I can't accept the fact
that he won't return.

645
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,840
He will come, sir.
He will come.

646
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,880
Hari wants to ask you
some questions.

647
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,240
Yes. What do you
want to know? Ask me.

648
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,280
Did Guptan have any close friends?

649
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,160
He was a loner.

650
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,960
He came with a few
college students recently

651
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,400
and stayed for two days.

652
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,760
The house was filled with music
and poetry. They had a good time.

653
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,800
That's when I came to know

654
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,680
that Guptan was a visiting
professor in some college.

655
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,040
Which was the college?

656
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,480
He mentioned some name.

657
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,880
I forgot it.

658
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,640
Can you try to remember it?

659
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,200
No. I did not take it seriously.

660
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,640
Was anyone else close to Guptan?

661
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,640
Yes.

662
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,160
If Guptan was alive

663
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,320
he would have been
married by this time.

664
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,720
He never wanted to get married

665
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,360
but he told me recently

666
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,480
that a girl, who I might like

667
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,960
would be with him
to celebrate this festival.

668
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,960
What did he say
about that girl?

669
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:39,880
He just mentioned the name Mohini.

670
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,280
Was it Mohini or Mira?

671
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,920
No. It was Mohini.
Mohini Varma.

672
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,880
What is it?
Why are you shocked? - No.

673
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,120
It's nothing, sir.
- Okay.

674
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,680
We want to visit
Guptan's bedroom and study room.

675
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:01,000
Of course. The room is upstairs
on the east facing end.

676
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,600
Nothing has been changed.
Everything is intact.

677
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,280
Please proceed.
- Okay. - Yes.

678
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,320
His dad did not make a mistake.

679
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,040
It was not Mira either.

680
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,120
We were the ones who
made a mistake.

681
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,960
Mohini Varma is not fictitious.

682
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:27,840
I have found the letters
she wrote to Guptan.

683
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,280
So have I.

684
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:41,760
Mohini Varma is
part of a riddle.

685
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:45,000
She truly loved and admired Guptan.

686
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:48,400
She is either equally talented
or may be better than Guptan.

687
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,840
You may take these
and keep it there.

688
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Move it.

689
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,600
What?
Did you see everything?

690
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,440
Yes. We are leaving, sir.

691
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,520
What is this?

692
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,400
You came to my house
and are leaving

693
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:04,560
without staying or having a meal..
- We have lots of work, sir.

694
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,160
We are taking the letters and
poems written by Mohini to Guptan.

695
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,520
We will return it.
Do you mind? - No problem.

696
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:15,040
But when you leave so soon..
- We will be back soon.

697
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,520
Didn't I tell you?
This is Ramappan's son.

698
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,760
Dr. Jaikumar.

699
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,320
I am Hari.

700
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:33,720
I am Krishnan.

701
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,080
This is my brother, Premkumar.

702
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,200
Hello.
- I'm Hari.

703
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,280
I'm Krishnan.

704
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,080
We shall leave.

705
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,520
What is it?
Are you here to question me?

706
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,720
No. But we have to.

707
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,520
Nice. This is the apt place
to dispel guilt.

708
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,200
I'm asking you something
out of the blue.

709
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,760
Did Guptan have another lover?

710
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,280
Not another lover.

711
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,080
He had only one lover.

712
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,160
Mohini Varma.

713
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:44,720
So you knew about Guptan
and Mohini Varma

714
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,080
but you hid it.

715
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:47,800
Why?

716
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,840
What is this, Hari?

717
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,440
Mira will have her own reasons.

718
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,360
Mira loved Guptan.

719
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,360
But Guptan loved Mohini.

720
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:02,720
Any woman would lose her mind
when she knows that the guy

721
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,400
she loves is in love
with another woman.

722
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,280
Yes.
- If you can't convince your lover

723
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,320
you may even harm him.

724
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,880
If you have a wealthy dad

725
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,800
you may blame someone and escape.

726
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,120
You may build and live in a
pretty cabin to dispel your guilt.

727
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,960
When smart advocates
argue using these points

728
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,160
you will be trapped.

729
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,800
How were you related to Guptan

730
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,760
who came to Poonoor after
accepting Mohini's invitation?

731
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,280
I was only a friend

732
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,200
who helped Guptan

733
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,280
in finding Mohini,
whom he never met.

734
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,920
Do you hear her, Hari?

735
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,480
Mira and Guptan were just friends.

736
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:42,600
Do you get it?

737
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:46,960
Why did you spend a night
with him in a hotel?

738
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:49,600
Shame on you!

739
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,520
Two advocates who are
famous all over the nation.

740
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,880
Now I know how narrow
your minds are.

741
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,680
If Hari and Krishnan
share the same room

742
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,400
is there anything immoral in it?

743
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:06,680
You cannot believe
that a guy and a girl

744
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,360
can spend time together morally.

745
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,680
It's because you cannot
be like that.

746
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:15,480
But Guptan could do that.
So could I.

747
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,840
We discussed
Mohini's letters and poems.

748
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:25,360
We spent a whole night
in the hotel room.

749
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:26,600
It's true.

750
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:31,960
But we shared his dreams
about Mohini.

751
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,120
Not the bed.

752
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,560
I've known Guptan
for just a few days.

753
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:41,720
We became close
on our first meeting itself.

754
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,120
The books we read were similar.

755
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,480
We had like thoughts.

756
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,960
Even the topics for our research
were the same.

757
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,240
I wanted him to be my mentor.

758
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,720
But he wanted us to be friends.

759
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:57,920
You guys don't know

760
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,440
who and what he was.

761
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:01,920
We know some of it.

762
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,240
Guptan was an eccentric who knew
the highs and lows of life.

763
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:12,640
At the same time,
a great dreamer.

764
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,440
While he was studying
for his MA in Indore

765
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,560
Mohini was doing
her first year of her BA.

766
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:23,360
She wrote many letters to Guptan
from Delhi.

767
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:26,240
A poor girl who was trapped
by some people.

768
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,080
It might be her husband

769
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,760
or some gangsters.

770
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:31,760
Anyway, she was held
in a gilded cage.

771
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,680
She wrote many poems to escape
from the pain.

772
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,320
She wanted a life with him.

773
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,120
Guptan loved her poems.

774
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:38,400
He loved her through them.

775
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:42,200
He went to Poonoor
when she asked him to come.

776
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,320
This is what we know.

777
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,800
You know the rest.

778
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,560
Even I know only this much.

779
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:54,840
We went searching for her
in Poonoor.

780
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:56,840
But we couldn't find her.

781
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,760
She is hiding somewhere.

782
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:01,680
I want to find her.

783
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,880
I want to know why she invited him

784
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:06,880
and made him fall in love.

785
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,200
We should save her
if she is innocent.

786
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,160
We should punish her
if she is found guilty.

787
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:12,760
I am clear about one thing.

788
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,680
If everyone comes to know that
the investigation is against her..

789
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:20,600
She or the ones who are hiding
her might escape from here. - Yes.

790
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,040
That is the reason
why you portrayed Gabriel

791
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:28,120
as the culprit and hid everything,
isn't it? - Yes.

792
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,560
You wish to keep her name

793
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,840
out of this case.

794
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,120
Yes.
- Okay.

795
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,600
As we have started to understand
each other

796
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,600
we would never stand against
your wishes.

797
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:44,600
Apart from that

798
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,120
we will find Mohini Varma for you
in nine days.

799
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,240
Okay?
- Yes.

800
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,560
But a lot of her letters
are missing.

801
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,200
No. I have them.

802
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:56,560
Can we see them?

803
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:57,800
It's at home.

804
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:58,840
Okay, then we will come
in the morning..

805
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,280
Yes.. at 10 in the morning.

806
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,800
Can we leave now?

807
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:07,040
We know that some of our questions
may have bothered you.

808
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,960
Which one?
The one about the bed?

809
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,960
Well.. - Please forgive us, it's
the trait of being advocates.

810
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:14,480
No hard feelings.
- Hey, never mind.

811
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:27,640
So can we leave? - Okay, bye..
- See you.

812
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,560
Why trouble that poor Gabriel..

813
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,840
Can't you release him today itself?
- Sure..

814
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:08,840
Why did you stop the car?

815
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,000
You asked me to stop.
- Did I?

816
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,720
You did, didn't you?
Why?

817
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,920
I wanted to take a leak.

818
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,240
Make it fast.
- Sure.

819
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:30,160
Finally, I found out
that it was worth the long wait.

820
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:35,000
Mira was born for me.

821
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,080
I have to thank Ammalu
for everything.

822
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:41,440
Her face..

823
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,680
I felt that pinch of love

824
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:47,720
at the very first sight.

825
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,080
That closeness..

826
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:56,360
Ammalu, thank you so much
for bringing Mira into my life.

827
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,840
The tree which is shy to blossom.

828
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,520
The day that forgot to end.

829
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:07,600
It's like a new feeling found me.

830
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,520
What's going on?
Are you flooding the place?

831
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,040
It's been a while.
Aren't you done yet?

832
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,440
I'm done..
I'm coming.

833
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:20,120
I was thinking of getting
Gabriel out.

834
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:22,640
Me too.

835
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,440
Come..
- Come.

836
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,280
A random college.

837
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:34,600
A visiting professor
had taught there.

838
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:38,200
He was a poet, vocalist,
philosopher and a gentleman.

839
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:43,120
He was close with a six-member
gang of students.

840
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,320
Which college was it?
Who was the professor?

841
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,760
Who were the students?

842
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,960
Find these out and report it
to Sundaran.

843
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:56,640
All information from Chennai Agency
will be strictly confidential.

844
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,400
It should only be handled by Hari,
Sundaran and me.

845
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:01,520
Okay?
- Okay.

846
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:04,560
Read this.

847
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,680
Who monitors the data
from Chennai? - Stephen does.

848
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:10,760
Should we ask anything of Mira?

849
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,320
I think we don't have to.

850
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:16,040
Yes. Her thoughts and decisions
are strange.

851
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,600
Then again, it has helped us
to a certain extent.

852
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:21,680
How? - Isn't it because of her
suing Gabriel

853
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:22,800
that Ammalu summoned us?

854
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:23,760
Didn't it pan out well?

855
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,960
Yes.. I've promised
to meet with her tomorrow.

856
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,080
Yes. We will meet her
tomorrow at 10 a.m.

857
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,360
Yes. Maybe around 10:30 a.m.

858
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:40,680
Drat!

859
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,320
Krishnan!
- Yes?

860
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:08,720
Mira is mine!
- Mira is mine!

861
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,800
Fantastic! Great!

862
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,200
Great, indeed!
- Isn't it?

863
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:21,360
So Mira is mine!
- No. Mira is mine alone.

864
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:22,600
Stop kidding.

865
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:25,320
I decided
when I saw her up close.

866
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:29,720
I made the decision when I
saw her from a distance.

867
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,040
Stop joking, Krishnan.

868
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,680
I'm serious.
- I'm even more serious.

869
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:35,960
Quit it, will you?

870
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,560
I know that you
are pulling my strings. - No.

871
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,520
I'm saying this from
the bottom of my heart.

872
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:41,880
Mira is mine!

873
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,160
No! She is mine!

874
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,760
Am I not older by a year or so?

875
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,920
That is based on the records.
You are much older.. - Leave it..

876
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,440
It has already been decided.
- Yes.

877
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:50,800
It is!

878
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,840
If Kallookkaran Vishwambharan
has a daughter named Mira

879
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:57,760
she is mine! She's for advocate
Harikrishnan alias Krishnan!

880
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:00,440
You can kiss your dreams goodbye.

881
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:05,040
Krishnan, if I am Hari
of Harikrishnans Associates

882
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,600
I won't kiss anything goodbye

883
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,200
and no guy named Krishnan
is going to get

884
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,640
Vishwambharan's daughter Mira.

885
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:16,280
Key..
- Thank you..

886
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:19,800
Okay.
So you love Mira.

887
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:21,560
Yes.
- How much?

888
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:24,360
A lot.
- Is it as vast as the sky?

889
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:28,960
Yes. - So your love for her
is as vast as the sky.

890
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,920
Now ask me how much I love her.

891
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,280
Ask me.
- I'm not going to.

892
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:34,960
Why?
- I prefer not to. - Hey!

893
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,640
Why are you being a baby about it?

894
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,640
Mira is the only girl
for me in this lifetime.

895
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:40,520
Mine too.
- Okay.

896
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,240
Krishnan, this is meant to be.

897
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:54,320
Or else why didn't I even think
of even getting married?

898
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:55,640
That's because you couldn't
find a girl!

899
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:57,960
Me? Really?

900
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,880
Who do you think you are?
Prince Charming?

901
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,680
What girl in her right mind
will be attracted

902
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,800
by your crooked teeth,
gummy smile

903
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,600
those giant nasal openings
and your horsey gait?

904
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:18,320
What?
- Girls will fly down from Egypt

905
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:19,400
and line up for you on seeing

906
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,960
your pumpkin-like cheeks,
squishy nose

907
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,960
and your lopsided gait.

908
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,840
Cover that nose, Krishnan.

909
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,880
Let some girls look at your face.

910
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:32,000
Enough..
Don't overdo it..

911
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:56,800
Oh, sorry.

912
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:58,240
What is this special ritual?

913
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,600
This was taught to me
by my grandmother.

914
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,400
To find answers to
unanswerable questions.

915
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:04,400
How do you do it?

916
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:09,440
If the leaf falls on 'Yes',
I'll meet Mohini Varma.

917
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,200
But the leaf fell on 'No'.

918
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,080
It means I am not going
to meet Mohini.

919
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,440
It has never gone wrong.

920
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,720
Harikrishnans cannot bring
Mohini Varma in front of me.

921
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,120
Let's see.

922
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,000
You can try.
But it is not going to happen.

923
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:23,280
Let me clean it.
Nobody is supposed to see this.

924
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,320
Take your seat.

925
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:26,640
Let's have a cup of tea.

926
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:28,640
You are well prepared, Mira.

927
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:30,680
We are friends now.

928
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,760
We are more than friends.
- Yes, even more than that.

929
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,360
Can we see the letters and poems
written by Mohini?

930
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:39,920
I will give it to you.
Please sit down.

931
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,720
People need to have good taste
in literature to enjoy poetry.

932
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,320
Yes.. I have good knowledge
of literature since childhood.

933
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:53,680
I am sorry.

934
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:02,880
No. I will clean it.

935
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,400
Oh, no.

936
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:41,400
I am sorry.

937
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:44,960
You have spilt it, too.
You are similar to each other.

938
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:01,760
Have your tea.

939
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:03,880
It's really hot.
Let it cool down.

940
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:07,320
I started to boil tea like this
after I met Guptan.

941
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:11,320
He used to love having tea
when it was served hot.

942
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,520
These are the letters and poems
written by Mohini.

943
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:37,320
Have your tea.

944
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:59,520
Guptan had set aside the most
beautiful 20 poems from Mohini.

945
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:03,080
He wanted to publish them with her
permission after meeting her.

946
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:09,160
We can't publish these poems
without her permission.

947
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:14,600
It would be a great loss
to Malayalam literature

948
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:17,960
if they don't get published.

949
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:23,400
Your wish to adorn Malayalam
literature with these poems

950
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:25,600
will be fulfilled at any cost.

951
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:30,320
I will be the one to do..
- We will do it for you.

952
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:38,080
I hope you can accomplish this
as soon as possible.

953
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,920
We badly want to accomplish
that.

954
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:42,960
Yes, we will do it.

955
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,880
Mira, we are taking these poems
with us.

956
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,360
Don't lose it somewhere.
- I won't.

957
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:49,440
Mira.
- Yes.

958
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:53,920
Which wood did you use
to make that bridge?

959
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:55,240
Which bridge?

960
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:56,960
That one.
Please come here.

961
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:58,960
Mira, one minute.

962
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,800
Did you make these house
based on ancient architecture

963
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:04,240
or according to the techniques
used by the Japanese?

964
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:07,120
It's an ordinary..
- Mira.

965
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:11,520
Where did you get that
Mexican snow flower? Please come.

966
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,240
Krishnan. We need to go.
We have work to do. Come on.

967
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:20,480
Okay, bye.

968
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:25,240
Even though we met
during a legal battle

969
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:28,560
but we have a relationship..
- Hari, we should go.

970
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,920
We have work to do.
- Yes. We need to go.

971
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:36,680
You can expect any kind of help
from me.

972
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:39,400
It can be anything.
- As a friend, he will help you.

973
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:41,720
Yes. As a friend, I will help you.
- Yes, as a friend.

974
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:43,640
As a friend.
- Yes, as a friend.

975
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:56,960
When I offered to help Mira
whenever she needs me

976
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,640
why was it necessary to bring
friendship in between that?

977
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:00,880
Yes, it is necessary.

978
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:05,360
It is not right to talk to a girl
like that.

979
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:07,000
What is wrong?
- It is wrong.

980
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:10,440
It is a vulgar statement.
- Let it be vulgar.

981
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,240
I was talking to Mira,
not to your wife.

982
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:14,160
What if I marry her in future?

983
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:16,400
She will get married.
But she will be my wife.

984
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:19,080
Don't talk nonsense.
- Who is talking nonsense now?

985
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:23,280
You are the one who claimed a girl
as his wife without her consent.

986
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:25,680
I said that. Don't talk to me
again, Krishnan.

987
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,960
You can leave, Krishnan. I will
take care of this case. - No.

988
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:29,720
You can leave. I will take care
of this alone.

989
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:32,240
This case is related to my sister.
I will take care of it.

990
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:33,840
I didn't transfer this case to you.

991
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,360
Harikrishnan Associates
are not related to this case.

992
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:40,480
It's true. Let's stop this company
forever from today.

993
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:44,320
We are departing forever.
Harikrishnan Associates is closed.

994
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:45,360
But I will take care of this case.

995
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,880
Let's see
who will plead this case.

996
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:48,960
Let's see.

997
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:50,240
Yes. Let's see.

998
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:10,400
Will you take photographs
of people travelling in cars?

999
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,280
I will.
Hari!

1000
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:16,840
What is the matter?

1001
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:20,800
Why do you take photographs
of people travelling in cars?

1002
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:24,320
I didn't do it.
Krishnan!

1003
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:39,720
Move!

1004
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,240
I took the photographs.
- Nothing official about it.

1005
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:10,960
Come here..
Let's have a duel.

1006
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:13,920
We took your photographs
because you were following us.

1007
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:17,960
Who sent you to follow us?

1008
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:20,120
Tell me..
Tell us about it.

1009
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:28,200
Tell us before we lose patience.
Else, we will go mad.

1010
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,880
We are mad now.

1011
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:41,200
Start the vehicle. - What?
- Start the vehicle!

1012
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:50,040
Take us to Kunjikuttan.

1013
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:53,440
We're taking a nap.
Don't wake us.

1014
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:04,080
Where are the others?

1015
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:08,760
Tell me what happened.
Did you mess them up?

1016
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,880
Where did the lawyers
run off to?

1017
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:14,960
I have brought them. - What?
- They are in the car.

1018
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:16,520
What are they doing in the car?

1019
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,640
My God. Sasi, what happened?

1020
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:35,960
They are dead, Sasi.
Now I have murdered more people.

1021
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:39,880
What do I do?
Sasi, they are dead.

1022
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:42,320
We are not dead.
We were killed.

1023
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:48,040
What?
- We are not dead. We were killed..

1024
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:51,440
I didn't tell you to kill them.

1025
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:54,200
What did you do?
- Kunjikuttan!

1026
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:59,160
We should settle that murder case.
- I don't know anything.

1027
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:01,400
Guptan's murder case.
Did you forget?

1028
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:04,080
Don't forget that you're
talking to Harikrishnans.

1029
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:08,280
You should forgive everything
and save me.

1030
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:11,880
The two of you should settle
this case for me.

1031
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:16,280
Sure. You might get 20 years
of rigorous imprisonment

1032
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:20,760
and then the death penalty.

1033
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,920
My God.
- We can fix all that.

1034
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:26,600
Instead of the 20 years
of rigorous imprisonment

1035
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:29,720
you will get the death penalty.
- That's enough. My God!

1036
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:32,960
If you have the desire to live

1037
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:34,840
we'll get rid of the
death penalty too.

1038
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:39,240
But, you should tell us the truth
about what happened to Guptan.

1039
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:42,480
I killed him.
- That's what we're talking about.

1040
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,320
What did you say?
- I killed him.

1041
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:47,480
Who did you kill?
- Guptan.

1042
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:49,920
How?
- I kicked him hard.

1043
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:54,280
Why? - I'll tell you the truth.
- Tell us.

1044
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:57,640
I killed him so I can marry
my prospective bride. - Is that so?

1045
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:58,800
He was trying to seduce her.

1046
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:01,880
She lived with her in a hotel room.

1047
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:07,960
He was talking to two people when
I went to visit him at the hotel.

1048
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:13,320
I waited for an hour.
I went inside after they left.

1049
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:14,320
What happened?

1050
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:17,800
He was drunk and unconscious.
I kicked him hard.

1051
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:20,800
I didn't think that the
kick would be fatal.

1052
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:23,200
He died immediately
without even a struggle.

1053
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:27,400
I don't know what I did.
I was out of control.

1054
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:32,320
I dropped the body from the top
to make it look like a suicide.

1055
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:35,440
I used Gabriel's axe on the body
to make it look like it was him.

1056
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:39,200
I tried several things,
but nothing worked.

1057
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:43,440
I did all this so I
can marry my Mira.

1058
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:46,280
You can't marry her anyway.
- Why is that?

1059
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,960
Tell him, Krishnan. I can't.
- I'll tell you.

1060
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:53,040
Come with me.
Since you've told us so much

1061
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:55,320
we should tell you the truth.
- Yes.

1062
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:59,160
We are trying our best

1063
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:02,080
to marry Mira.

1064
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:04,720
What? - It's true.
You must be so happy.

1065
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:10,240
If all three of us fight for Mira,
it won't be good.

1066
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:14,880
If you back off this case,
we'll take care of the murder case.

1067
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:17,560
I have already backed out.
- I need to ask you something.

1068
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:20,320
Come
- I told you I'm done.

1069
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:21,600
Come. We have to talk.

1070
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:26,560
You told me that there were
two people with Guptan that day.

1071
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,760
Could you recognise them again?

1072
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:31,560
Yes. If I see them in person.

1073
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:35,080
Kunjikuttan, we'll show them
or their photographs to you.

1074
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:38,960
If you tell anyone that
we were looking for them

1075
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:43,440
we'll make sure that
you get the death penalty.

1076
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:47,280
Let's go and pee.
- I've already peed.

1077
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:50,480
I need to pee.
- Go and take a piss, go. - Come.

1078
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:58,000
Is Guptan handsome?
- He is very smart.

1079
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:02,200
Is he as good as us?
- Not that much..

1080
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:03,640
What does Guptan wear often?

1081
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:06,960
When I saw him, a loose Kurta,
pants, glasses, and a shoulder bag.

1082
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:07,880
Does he wear glasses?
- Yes.

1083
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:09,920
You haven't peed yet.

1084
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:13,400
Sometimes,
I pee in gaseous form.

1085
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,160
Right now, I'm peeing in gaseous
form. That's why you can't see it.

1086
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:22,160
Give us a lift in that
useless vehicle of yours.

1087
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:23,880
Sure.
- Sasi!

1088
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:26,360
Sasi!

1089
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:40,280
Did you know?
- What?

1090
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:43,960
Mira is going to get married.

1091
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:48,080
It's not like I say every time.
I'll make sure it happens.

1092
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:51,120
You've been saying this
for a long time.

1093
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,200
This won't happen.
Get that in your head.

1094
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:58,040
This will happen, Uncle.
I agree.

1095
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:02,680
Everyone knows that.
But Mira won't agree.

1096
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:06,480
Aunt, Mira will say yes.

1097
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:08,440
She likes them.

1098
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:11,280
Aren't you talking about yourself?

1099
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:14,760
Not me. I backed out.

1100
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,280
I'm talking about Harikrishnans.

1101
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:22,320
Who are they?
- They like Mira very much.

1102
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,880
This couldn't have been a reality
if I had married Mira.

1103
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:32,480
Both of them take turns
to love her.

1104
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:36,920
We can't give her to the both
of them. - We'll do a coin toss.

1105
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:46,280
You were right.
Kunjikuttan didn't do anything.

1106
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:48,840
He thinks that he
committed the murder.

1107
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:56,680
Even if it is a murder or
suicide, this was a result

1108
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:59,560
of the relationship
between Guptan and Mohini.

1109
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:04,560
That is why we should find
the mystery behind Mohini Varma.

1110
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:08,040
There is a Mohini
who fooled Lord Shiva.

1111
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:12,360
One of Lord Vishnu's incarnations.
Maybe it is something like that.

1112
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:16,280
Did you see?
- Yes.

1113
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:18,480
Kunjikuttan recognised them.

1114
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:24,480
But there is more.
This is the report from Chennai.

1115
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:28,000
On the day Guptan was murdered
and the day before that

1116
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:31,800
he was taking part in a meeting
where the Governor was the guest.

1117
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:36,320
Yes. There is a copy of the minutes
of that meeting in this.

1118
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:41,480
Mr. Sundaran.

1119
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:47,520
Harikrishnans might
fail in this case.

1120
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:54,120
No. That won't happen.

1121
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:58,680
I'll look for loopholes.
Both of you need some rest.

1122
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:02,040
Set aside the case for a while
and think about something else.

1123
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:05,640
Look here.
"I'll give you"

1124
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:08,600
"a lot of cases."

1125
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:13,840
"Take rest,
happy Harikrishnans."

1126
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:18,880
Go. Take rest.

1127
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:23,040
I'm not going to take rest.
I'm going fishing..

1128
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:26,560
And you? - I haven't decided,
but I'm going to the restroom now.

1129
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:29,760
Where are you going?
You can't take rest. Sit down.

1130
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:41,960
Hello.
- Yes, I'm Hari.

1131
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:44,960
Which Hari?

1132
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,960
I'm Hari from Harikrishnans.
- What is the matter?

1133
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:52,240
I..
- What happened?

1134
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:53,960
Nothing..

1135
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:59,720
I need to see you.
We need to talk.

1136
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:02,960
Where do you want to meet?
- Wherever.

1137
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:04,920
Wherever you like..

1138
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:09,440
Wherever you like.
- At what time?

1139
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:14,080
At 5:00 p.m.
- Sure.

1140
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:18,600
I'll meet you near Lake View.
- Okay.

1141
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:20,120
I'll be waiting.

1142
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:29,560
Was it them?
I told you.

1143
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:35,440
That would also be them.

1144
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:46,240
Hello.
- This is Krishnan.

1145
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:56,440
What is the matter?
- I need to see you.

1146
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:01,160
At what time? - We will..
- Is 5 p.m. okay?

1147
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:02,760
Oh, yes..
We'll meet at 5 p.m.

1148
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:04,560
Where do you want to meet?

1149
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:06,240
Someplace you like.

1150
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:09,280
Okay. Then we'll meet
at Lake View at 5 p.m.

1151
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:10,560
Okay. Fine.

1152
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:12,760
Hari has also told me
to meet me there.

1153
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:15,360
Which Hari?
- Hari of Harikrishnans.

1154
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:17,960
Hasn't he told you?
- Y-Yes.

1155
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,160
H-He had told me..

1156
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:22,520
Okay. We'll meet there.

1157
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:23,880
Okay..

1158
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:25,280
Okay.

1159
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:41,840
I'm tired.

1160
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:45,960
I'm tired of thinking
about this case all the time.

1161
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:47,840
I need to get my mind relaxed.

1162
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:50,160
I'm going to a movie.
- Which movie?

1163
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:52,280
'Interesting Jack.'

1164
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:53,920
Is it?
- Yes.

1165
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,040
It's an awesome movie.

1166
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:56,400
You must definitely see it.

1167
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,120
Haven't you seen it yet?
- No, I'm going to see it today.

1168
01:20:58,280 --> 01:20:59,560
It will start in few minutes.
- Then go fast. - Yes.

1169
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:12,000
Ammalu!

1170
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:13,080
Hi, Krishnan.

1171
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:15,960
Take this first.

1172
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:17,520
I want your help.

1173
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:19,200
Don't tell him that I told you.

1174
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:22,440
You have to block Hari somehow

1175
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:24,240
between 4:45 p.m.
and 5:45 p.m. today evening.

1176
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,440
I..
- Don't ask me why..

1177
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:30,320
We're doing this for a case..
Please.

1178
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:33,840
Good evening, Hari.

1179
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:38,280
I'm stuck with this crossword
for the last two days.

1180
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:40,520
I want your help to complete this.

1181
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,440
Crossword?
No way. I'm very busy today.

1182
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:43,640
No, I won't let you leave.

1183
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:45,280
Yuck! What kind of dress is this?

1184
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:46,760
This is convenient for walking.

1185
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:49,920
Didn't you tell me to visit you
after 5 p.m. if I needed help?

1186
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:52,560
Yes, but we changed our
office time till 6 p.m.

1187
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:54,360
I don't care. Come.
- Listen to me.

1188
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:55,280
Come!

1189
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:12,600
Hari hasn't come.

1190
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:13,720
No, right?

1191
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:15,480
Don't expect him to come now.

1192
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:17,880
Hari does not have the habit
of keeping his word.

1193
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:20,040
He keeps blabbering.

1194
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:21,240
What can I do?

1195
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:24,040
I can't complain
since he is my friend.

1196
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:26,280
You said you had something
to say to me, right?

1197
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:30,080
Yes. I'll tell you.

1198
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:31,520
I was about to tell you.

1199
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:34,200
The matter which I have to say is..

1200
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:36,400
That is..

1201
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:38,320
That is..

1202
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:41,560
I asked you to meet me.

1203
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:45,400
That is something
which anyone can ask you.

1204
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:49,960
The main intention of what
I'm trying to say is..

1205
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:53,160
I..

1206
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:55,080
I..

1207
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:57,720
I..

1208
01:22:58,240 --> 01:22:59,840
If I get something to drink

1209
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:01,920
I would be happy to tell you.

1210
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:04,440
Is this good enough for you?

1211
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:09,760
Now you can tell me.

1212
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:12,040
The thing which I
have to tell you is..

1213
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:13,160
That is..

1214
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:15,120
Our case..

1215
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:18,280
Our investigation

1216
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:20,640
to find the evidence..

1217
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:23,120
And these pretty valleys
that provide the ambience

1218
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:24,760
for our investigation.

1219
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:27,040
The flock of sheep
which comes that way.

1220
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:29,680
The river stream
that flows with poise.

1221
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:33,560
The breeze that traverses
through the river.

1222
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:36,440
The breeze flows..

1223
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:39,920
Flows..

1224
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:42,720
Flows..

1225
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:46,640
Krishnan, how was the movie?

1226
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:48,160
Drop Ammalu back home.

1227
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:51,840
Make it quick.

1228
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:53,960
Why?

1229
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:55,960
You should drop her
since this was your plan.

1230
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:57,120
What are you talking about?

1231
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,520
She's very tired
after having those chocolates.

1232
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,120
What chocolate?
Who gave it to her?

1233
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:02,320
We'll discuss it later.
Now go and drop her. - Why?

1234
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:03,800
Just go!

1235
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:06,360
I'll go. But why are
you talking nonsense?

1236
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:12,800
What chocolates?
Come on, dear.

1237
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:19,120
Mira, I'll come back now.

1238
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:20,360
What was he saying?

1239
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:21,600
No. Nothing.

1240
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:23,760
He was describing the
beauty of nature.

1241
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:25,400
During his college days

1242
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:27,480
he has memorised many
dialogues about nature's beauty.

1243
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:28,560
He keeps blabbering it.

1244
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:30,320
I can't say anything
since he's my friend.

1245
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:32,520
You said you had something
to say to me.

1246
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:34,720
Yes.

1247
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:36,400
I have something to say to you.

1248
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:39,280
It is not something
very complicated.

1249
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:41,840
But I have to tell you personally.

1250
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:44,560
When I say this to you

1251
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:48,000
you would understand why

1252
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:49,680
I asked you to come here.

1253
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:53,080
But before I tell you..

1254
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:54,320
Do you need something to drink?

1255
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:56,120
Yes. That would be great.

1256
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:01,160
Now tell me.

1257
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:05,040
Get down..

1258
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:07,880
That is..

1259
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:12,960
I discovered recently

1260
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:17,360
that there is a budding
poet within me.

1261
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:26,800
Guptan's poems are wonderful.

1262
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:30,520
Here. You may not
have seen this one.

1263
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:33,160
I memorised it.

1264
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:34,880
I shall read it now.

1265
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:36,080
See if you have heard this before.

1266
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:43,920
"Don't you remember
our first meeting"

1267
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:50,440
"by the stream where
the water lilies grow?"

1268
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:06,600
"Don't you remember
our first meeting"

1269
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:09,960
"by the stream where
the water lilies grow?"

1270
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:13,440
"Oh, eloquence!
You emerged within me"

1271
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:16,760
"like a wave of beauty."

1272
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:23,200
"My mind is a sanctuary
to many a nostalgic song."

1273
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:29,800
"Your voice is a pleasant sound
that bloomed within me back then."

1274
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:36,880
"Why are you not talking to me,
then?"

1275
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:40,440
"Don't you remember
our first meeting"

1276
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:43,880
"by the stream where
the water lilies grow?"

1277
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:47,280
"Oh, eloquence!
You emerged within me"

1278
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:50,880
"like a wave of beauty."

1279
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:22,280
"The full moon welcomes you."

1280
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:29,040
"The nightly birds sing
along with your footsteps."

1281
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:35,840
"My mind awaits your consent."

1282
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:42,600
"I await your arrival."

1283
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:49,080
"Won't you come,
beautiful eloquence?"

1284
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:55,800
"I stay silent on a dark night
as the moonlight."

1285
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:59,520
"Don't you remember
our first meeting"

1286
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:02,880
"by the stream where
the water lilies grow?"

1287
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:06,400
"Oh, eloquence!
You emerged within me"

1288
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:10,560
"like a wave of beauty."

1289
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:41,360
"Why veil yourself,
my silent love?"

1290
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:48,040
"Why shroud yourself
like a stranger?"

1291
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:54,840
"You are what I sought
throughout this journey."

1292
01:28:55,320 --> 01:29:01,560
"You are the essence
of my favourite song."

1293
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:08,160
"Won't you come,
playing your heavenly music?"

1294
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:14,880
"The spring has come.
Do come, my dear."

1295
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:18,520
"Don't you remember
our first meeting"

1296
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:21,920
"by the stream where
the water lilies grow?"

1297
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:25,360
"Oh, eloquence!
You emerged within me"

1298
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:28,840
"like a wave of beauty."

1299
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:34,920
"My mind is a sanctuary
to many a nostalgic song."

1300
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:41,880
"Your voice is a pleasant sound
that bloomed within me back then."

1301
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:48,720
"Why are you not talking to me,
then?"

1302
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:52,400
"Don't you remember
our first meeting"

1303
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:55,760
"by the stream where
the water lilies grow?"

1304
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:59,240
"Oh, eloquence!
You emerged within me"

1305
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:03,520
"like a wave of beauty."

1306
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:14,160
What did you two want
to say to me?

1307
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:17,160
W-Well..
- This was it.

1308
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:19,800
Y-Yes.

1309
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:22,200
We have nothing else to say.
This was it.

1310
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:24,240
Then I am leaving.

1311
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:25,880
Okay.

1312
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:29,480
See you.

1313
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:41,360
I.. - I am the one who invited
Mira. Why did you come?

1314
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:43,840
You came here asking me
to drop Ammalu.

1315
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:45,480
I didn't do that.
- Did I bring Ammalu here?

1316
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:46,640
Did I? - What?
- Did I?

1317
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:49,040
If you had a little bit
of literary sense

1318
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:50,960
you would have understood
our relationship. - Bullshit!

1319
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:53,520
I am Krishnan.
Mira always worships Krishna.

1320
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:56,000
Not just a worshipper.
She loves him.

1321
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:57,840
You are right.
But the Krishna is only

1322
01:30:58,080 --> 01:30:59,280
a minor human incarnation

1323
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:01,640
of the Lord Vishnu.

1324
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:03,720
Mira really worships Lord Vishnu.

1325
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:05,760
Lord Vishnu is Hari.
Hari is Lord Vishnu.

1326
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:07,360
You saying that
won't change anything.

1327
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:09,280
Mira has to decide that, too.
- Who will Mira choose? - Krishna.

1328
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:10,640
No. Hari!
- Krishna! - No.

1329
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:13,520
Hari! - We will see! - No. Hari!
- Krishna! - Hari! - Krishna!

1330
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:15,040
Yes. We will see!
- Okay!

1331
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:34,240
Is this some kind of strike?

1332
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:35,920
Screw the strike!

1333
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:38,040
I am leaving.
I am going to leave.

1334
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:40,400
To where?
- To hell!

1335
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:44,000
Are you Hades to do that?
- Don't mess with me!

1336
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:46,480
Okay. I need to go
to the head office. - Wait.

1337
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:48,560
Head office?
- But we are not done here yet.

1338
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:52,160
The case here won't end
that easily.

1339
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:53,880
I realise that now.

1340
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:55,400
What an investigation!

1341
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:57,880
Is there no other murder case
in the world?

1342
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,800
Hari and Krishnan came here..
- Go on.

1343
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:02,760
...to sing and dance
while investigating.

1344
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:04,880
"Pretty woman
with beautiful eyes.."

1345
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:06,600
Mind your words!
- "Sankari, Mouli, Nangeli"

1346
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:08,720
"and other women.."
- Come on. Go to your seats.

1347
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:10,080
Look here, everyone.

1348
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:11,640
I am going to say everything.

1349
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:13,320
All of you go to your seats.

1350
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:14,520
Okay.

1351
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:17,320
What are you saying,
Mr. Sundaran?

1352
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:19,080
I am talking craziness.
Crazy.

1353
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:21,640
Consider
that I cursed you a lot.

1354
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,160
Hey!
- Shut up!

1355
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:28,400
You are Hari and Krishnan.

1356
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:30,440
I agree that you are great
and powerful.

1357
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:33,440
But if you're scolded
once in a while when required

1358
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:35,800
you won't be powerful
or great anymore.

1359
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:38,360
I think you are mistaken,
Mr. Sundaran.

1360
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:40,720
I am not mistaken.

1361
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:43,280
I understand everything.
Give me my suitcase.

1362
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:45,800
What case is he talking about?
- I don't know.

1363
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:50,000
That case.
It won't be solved at this rate.

1364
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:56,080
My elder daughter and her husband
are coming from Singapore

1365
01:32:56,360 --> 01:32:57,680
Four months pregnant.

1366
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,560
Who? - Not the husband.
- Okay.

1367
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:03,920
Okay.
Was that a joke?

1368
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:05,000
Laugh, everyone.

1369
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:06,240
Or I will laugh myself.

1370
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:10,800
Even if my daughter
gives birth 16 times

1371
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:13,360
this case won't end.
I know that.

1372
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:14,560
Do you know why?
- Hey!

1373
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:17,000
I will tell you. - Let's talk.
Come on. - I will.

1374
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:18,920
Okay.
- Let me tell them.

1375
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:21,040
We won't let you say that
in there.

1376
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:22,200
Let go!

1377
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:25,760
If you want to marry
Mr. Vishwambharan's daughter

1378
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:26,720
then let's go.

1379
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:28,160
I will come with you
to propose.

1380
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:33,480
But only one of you
can come with me.

1381
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:36,240
You have to decide
who that person is right now.

1382
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:37,480
Tell me.

1383
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:41,680
Me.
- Me.

1384
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:49,920
If you fight over money,
it can be resolved.

1385
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:52,960
But if you fight over a woman,
nothing can solve it.

1386
01:33:57,360 --> 01:34:01,000
I want Hari and Krishnan

1387
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:05,320
to be together always.

1388
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:07,280
What did you decide?

1389
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:08,800
Should I stay or leave?

1390
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:12,600
I understand what you said,
as our big brother.

1391
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:15,320
We won't think of anything else

1392
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:18,080
until this case is solved.
That's a promise.

1393
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:21,160
Me too.

1394
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:23,560
Aren't you leaving now?
- What?

1395
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:25,480
Aren't you?
- I am not. - What?

1396
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:27,920
I have got something.
I will show you.

1397
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:35,960
I have some information about
the six people connected to Guptan.

1398
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:40,320
They are the students of
St. Francis College, Athipuzha.

1399
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:45,080
They know everything
about Mohini Varma.

1400
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:48,160
There is no reason
to stay here anymore.

1401
01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:50,920
We have to go live in Athipuzha
without anyone finding out.

1402
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:53,160
Let's go tomorrow.
- Yes. - Okay.

1403
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:55,480
I need to see someone. - Who?
- Who? - I can't tell you that.

1404
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:03,360
So tomorrow we are going to..
- Say goodbye to this place.

1405
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:10,960
I am a lawyer who works

1406
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,400
in Harikrishnans Associates.

1407
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:16,800
There are a lot of employees
like me.

1408
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:20,680
Because of you,
Hari and Krishnan

1409
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:23,120
have some desires in their hearts.

1410
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:27,880
You would have known that, too.

1411
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:30,960
If this continues,
they will fight each other

1412
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:32,760
and destroy this establishment.

1413
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:36,080
That's why I am sending them
to Athipuzha tomorrow.

1414
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:37,680
They won't come back.

1415
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:40,000
I am here to apologise
for their actions

1416
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:40,920
and to tell you to forget it.

1417
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:48,080
I can't forget that easily.

1418
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:50,920
I need to know
if their love is true.

1419
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:55,400
If it is, I need to know
who loves me more.

1420
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:01,520
I won't change my mind.

1421
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:02,760
Move.

1422
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:04,360
What?

1423
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:07,720
They have a lot of women
after them.

1424
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:09,600
I am such a woman.

1425
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:14,600
I mean that

1426
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:17,520
I am not going to let
them go that easily.

1427
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:19,840
You don't have to.

1428
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:23,320
Don't tell that I came here
and told you this, okay?

1429
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:26,680
Will you?
- Yes.

1430
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:29,040
What?
- No.

1431
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:31,360
Yes.
- What? - No.

1432
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:34,520
What?
- Yes. - No.

1433
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:35,640
Okay.

1434
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:44,680
This office needs
only two people now.

1435
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,360
The rest can go to the head office.

1436
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:48,320
You should take care of everything
and come there.

1437
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:50,200
My daughter and her husband
are coming from Singapore.

1438
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:52,480
Let them come.

1439
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:09,080
I haven't leaked anything
about your journey.

1440
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:11,480
In this journey to find
Mohini Varma

1441
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:13,600
I want to come with you.

1442
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:16,920
We can't be sure about the leak.

1443
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:18,960
Since you came here prepared

1444
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:21,040
we can't stop you.

1445
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:23,200
We don't know how long or where

1446
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:25,320
we are going to stay.

1447
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:26,520
That's all right.

1448
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:28,840
Get in.

1449
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:49,600
Okay. At this rate,
we can decide soon enough.

1450
01:37:54,440 --> 01:37:57,840
Thomas Mathew, Stephen,
Radhakrishnan

1451
01:37:58,040 --> 01:38:00,640
Sudarsanan, Cletus, Basheer.

1452
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:02,480
These are the six people.

1453
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:06,840
But the connection of them
to a Mohini Varma

1454
01:38:07,320 --> 01:38:08,320
is not something we know.

1455
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:10,480
After the murder of Mr. Guptan

1456
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:13,240
none of this six people
has come back to the hostel.

1457
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,960
As their warden,
what do you say, sir?

1458
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:17,800
I asked their families.

1459
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:20,960
Most of them contact their families
through the phone.

1460
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:23,000
They said they are on tour.

1461
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:25,800
That signifies a little escape
on the pretext of a tour.

1462
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:26,960
Isn't it?

1463
01:38:27,320 --> 01:38:28,760
We don't know that.

1464
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:30,920
Okay.

1465
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:33,160
Thank you, sir.
- Welcome. - Thank you very much.

1466
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:37,360
Okay.
Thank you very much.

1467
01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:45,840
Mr. Sundaran.

1468
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:48,200
Those six guys are hiding
somewhere around here.

1469
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:50,360
I am going to fax you
their house addresses.

1470
01:38:51,080 --> 01:38:53,120
You have to find their hideout
and inform us.

1471
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:55,200
Only then can we go forward.

1472
01:38:56,280 --> 01:38:57,560
We are staying
at the guest house here.

1473
01:38:57,880 --> 01:38:58,920
We will eat from the hotel.

1474
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:04,960
You had promised
that you would bring

1475
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:07,560
Mohini to me in nine days.

1476
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:11,960
There are only three days left now.

1477
01:39:12,440 --> 01:39:15,720
Yes. The festival in Killikal
temple is only three days away.

1478
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:18,040
I have a lot promises to fulfil
on that day.

1479
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:20,920
But we need these six people
who are the last clue.

1480
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:23,160
They reached Poonoor the day before

1481
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:24,960
Guptan arrived.

1482
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:29,200
In Hotel Vrindavan

1483
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:31,760
they stayed in two rooms.

1484
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:33,360
They followed Guptan daily.

1485
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:36,360
They left the same night
on which Guptan was murdered.

1486
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:38,680
Okay.

1487
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:40,640
Where do you want to stay, Mira?

1488
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:42,400
Is it in the YWCA?

1489
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:44,480
In your guest house.

1490
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:49,640
I will stay there with you.

1491
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:54,640
Is that a problem?

1492
01:39:54,920 --> 01:39:56,920
It's not a problem. - It's not.
- It's all right. - It's all right.

1493
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:58,880
There are only two rooms there.

1494
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:02,480
We asked them to clean only one.
The other one is all dusty.

1495
01:40:02,640 --> 01:40:03,600
I can clean it up.

1496
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,880
It's okay.
We can clean it up.

1497
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:09,440
There!
- Keep it there!

1498
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:47,600
This will be fine.

1499
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:49,520
No. This is
more attractive.

1500
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,400
Even this is attractive.
This is fine.

1501
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:53,000
Damn it.
Remove it!

1502
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:54,880
Don't spread that sheet above this.

1503
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:57,800
Even you can't do that.
I won't allow it.

1504
01:40:57,920 --> 01:40:58,720
I won't allow you to do that.

1505
01:40:58,800 --> 01:40:59,600
Then let's do this.

1506
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:00,800
Let's spread them on either
half of the bed. - Okay, done.

1507
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:02,480
Spread it and feel satisfied.
- Okay.

1508
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:05,760
You won't even let
me do this for her.

1509
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:08,520
Yes, but she will marry me.

1510
01:41:08,720 --> 01:41:10,280
I'll be the one to marry her.

1511
01:41:10,360 --> 01:41:12,920
No way.
I will marry her.

1512
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:16,560
Do try. She will be sleeping
on my blue sheet tonight.

1513
01:41:16,640 --> 01:41:19,920
Come with me at night, and you
may see her sleeping on my side.

1514
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,960
I don't need your help.
I will come. - Even me.

1515
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:29,600
Come in, please.

1516
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:31,400
We arranged it all very fast.

1517
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:33,240
If you have any discomfort,
just call me.

1518
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:34,600
Just call me.
- Yes. - Okay.

1519
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:43,240
Goodnight.
- Very goodnight.

1520
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:45,400
See you.

1521
01:41:55,120 --> 01:41:57,520
When we wished her goodnight

1522
01:41:58,160 --> 01:42:00,400
she said 'see you'.
Did you notice that?

1523
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:01,960
Yes, I did.

1524
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:05,240
Did you notice she hasn't locked
the door? - Yes, I did.

1525
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:07,400
Why would she have done that?

1526
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:10,800
After all, she is an intellectual.

1527
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:13,960
She might be trying
to assess our character.

1528
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:16,040
Let's not be indecent!

1529
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:20,320
Let's bathe and go to bed.
- Yes.

1530
01:42:23,960 --> 01:42:25,120
Krishnan.
- Yes.

1531
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:28,080
We should keep in mind that Mira

1532
01:42:28,160 --> 01:42:31,040
came here just because
she trusts us. Shouldn't we?

1533
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:33,440
I feel sleepless on thinking of it.

1534
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:36,880
Let's forget about her and sleep.

1535
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:39,360
Isn't it?
- Yes, that's a nice idea.

1536
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:44,240
Hari, I may
become indecent tonight.

1537
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:46,720
Me, too. - What?
- What can we do now?

1538
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:49,640
I have an idea.

1539
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:51,480
It's a bit cheap.

1540
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:52,560
There is no other go.

1541
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:56,800
It's a mutual help which we do
to keep ourselves decent.

1542
01:42:57,440 --> 01:43:00,840
Let's sleep with our hands tied.

1543
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:32,640
I feel very happy.
What about you?

1544
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:34,240
Even I feel the same.

1545
01:43:58,240 --> 01:43:59,160
My God!

1546
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:04,360
Why did you tie your hands?

1547
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:08,680
Oh! - We wish to be closely
bonded even while sleeping.

1548
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:10,800
It is a practice we follow.

1549
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:12,280
It is a method to protect
our dignity.

1550
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:14,520
This method is very effective.

1551
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:16,840
It is followed by many people
for a long time.

1552
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:19,160
Even I have read many books.

1553
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:21,880
But I am hearing about this
for the first time.

1554
01:44:22,640 --> 01:44:26,280
Shall I ask you something?
- Okay. - Yes.

1555
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:29,480
From where do we'll have breakfast?
- From the hotel. - From the hotel.

1556
01:44:29,720 --> 01:44:31,960
Won't we be staying here
for two days? - Yes. - Yes.

1557
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:35,760
So I can cook food for you.
What do you say? - Great! - Great!

1558
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:37,920
We don't have anything
to cook food with.

1559
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:40,920
Everything has to be purchased.
- We'll get it. - We'll get it.

1560
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:44,680
Don't go together. Both of you
should purchase things separately.

1561
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:47,840
You should be familiar to deal
with such situations.

1562
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:49,280
I want to know who among you

1563
01:44:49,680 --> 01:44:53,120
is better in the role
of a family man.

1564
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:54,600
This is a test.

1565
01:44:55,680 --> 01:44:56,480
I..

1566
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:09,640
So fast!

1567
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:11,160
We bought everything.

1568
01:45:11,480 --> 01:45:15,280
First, a stove to boil water.
An electric stove.

1569
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:18,280
How will you use an electric stove
during a power failure!

1570
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:20,760
That is useless!
A gas stove is better.

1571
01:45:20,920 --> 01:45:23,040
Keeping yourself safe
is more important.

1572
01:45:23,120 --> 01:45:25,280
Here is the ointment if you singe
yourself. I brought two.

1573
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:29,560
Utensils designed for safety.
- Gloves to use in the kitchen.

1574
01:45:30,160 --> 01:45:31,480
What about food items?

1575
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:35,480
Yes. Salt, mustard, fennel,
pepper, chilly and coriander powder

1576
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:38,680
turmeric, tamarind, Sambar powder,
egg, fish and meat Masala powder

1577
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:42,360
ginger, onion, garlic
and green chilly.

1578
01:45:43,080 --> 01:45:45,080
Potatoes, drumsticks, melons

1579
01:45:45,160 --> 01:45:47,200
yams, cucumbers, purple yams

1580
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:49,840
taros, tomatoes, curry leaves

1581
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:52,720
Tulsi leaves, lemons, bananas,
pulses, snake gourds

1582
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:55,520
eggplants, ladies fingers, lettuce,
bitter gourds, cabbage

1583
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:57,360
carrots, spinach, beetroot,
cauliflower

1584
01:45:57,400 --> 01:45:58,200
elephant foot yams.

1585
01:45:59,080 --> 01:46:00,840
Rice, semolina, wheat flour,
millet, maize

1586
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:01,880
black, yellow and green lentils

1587
01:46:02,160 --> 01:46:03,560
coffee powder, tea dust, sugar

1588
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:05,080
jam, juice, dish wash soap

1589
01:46:05,480 --> 01:46:06,880
cup and saucer, plate, spoon

1590
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:08,760
toothbrush, toothpaste
and toothpicks.

1591
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:11,280
Apples, grapes, oranges,
mangoes, sapodillas

1592
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:13,520
coconuts, jackfruit,
broiler and organic chicken

1593
01:46:13,680 --> 01:46:15,280
mutton, beef, bread, eggs and milk.

1594
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:17,800
Utility and chef knives
and axes.

1595
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:18,760
Axe..

1596
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:20,360
Grinding stone, mixer, grinder

1597
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:21,720
casserole, measuring spoons..

1598
01:46:21,880 --> 01:46:22,920
Measuring cups..

1599
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:24,080
Enough..

1600
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:25,840
Now let's cook.
- We're ready. - We're ready.

1601
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:31,400
Who says that kitchen work
is only for women?

1602
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:33,280
Man and woman should work together.

1603
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:35,200
Cleaning is the most
important chore.

1604
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:37,960
A man should share work
by helping in cleaning.

1605
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:40,680
See! It's not helping.

1606
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:43,080
It is everyone's duty
to work together.

1607
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:45,440
Enough..
I will do the rest.

1608
01:46:46,120 --> 01:46:48,600
I don't know much
about your tastes.

1609
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:50,600
I like hot and spicy food.

1610
01:46:54,280 --> 01:46:57,320
I like it a bit sour and salty.

1611
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,080
Okay.
Take a bath and get ready.

1612
01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:05,240
Okay.

1613
01:47:06,040 --> 01:47:06,840
Here.

1614
01:47:48,080 --> 01:47:49,720
I prepared everything
on short notice.

1615
01:47:52,280 --> 01:47:55,200
If you don't like it, please
say so. - What's not to like?

1616
01:47:55,320 --> 01:47:57,640
I liked it on the first look
itself. - Me too.

1617
01:47:58,440 --> 01:47:59,240
Have it.

1618
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:34,320
It is great!

1619
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:35,840
I am not flattering you.

1620
01:48:36,920 --> 01:48:37,720
Wonderful!

1621
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:44,160
This is the tastiest food
I've ever had!

1622
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:48,880
Is it too spicy?
- Not at all!

1623
01:48:49,480 --> 01:48:51,200
Is it too salty?
- Not at all!

1624
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:53,160
Have it all.

1625
01:48:53,480 --> 01:48:55,280
Lunch will be late.

1626
01:48:56,680 --> 01:48:59,360
Water will ruin your appetite.
Yes. - Yes.

1627
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:06,960
Tasty, isn't it?

1628
01:49:34,680 --> 01:49:36,520
Would you like your lunch
to be like this?

1629
01:49:37,560 --> 01:49:39,240
Yes. That is good.

1630
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:41,800
Same here. I love it.

1631
01:49:46,760 --> 01:49:47,920
I thought

1632
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:50,080
that you would tell me

1633
01:49:50,840 --> 01:49:54,120
that it was too spicy

1634
01:49:54,200 --> 01:49:55,280
or it was too salty.

1635
01:49:57,960 --> 01:49:59,080
But you didn't.

1636
01:50:01,280 --> 01:50:04,080
When I realised that
both of you loved me

1637
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:05,840
I came here to know

1638
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:07,560
who loves me truly

1639
01:50:08,040 --> 01:50:09,520
and who loves me more.

1640
01:50:12,680 --> 01:50:15,920
I was attracted to you
at some point.

1641
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:18,200
Yes, it is true.

1642
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:22,040
But, today I realised something.

1643
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:26,080
There is not even a flicker
of love deep down in your hearts.

1644
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:30,080
You are just competing
with each other.

1645
01:50:30,640 --> 01:50:32,960
And neither one of you
is willing to lose.

1646
01:50:35,480 --> 01:50:38,360
At the end of your competition,
when both of you win

1647
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:40,680
whom should I choose to
spend the rest of my life with?

1648
01:50:41,080 --> 01:50:42,000
Tell me that.

1649
01:50:49,480 --> 01:50:50,800
I have just one life.

1650
01:50:51,240 --> 01:50:53,400
But I can't give it to you
by dividing it into two.

1651
01:50:55,400 --> 01:50:58,560
I have failed in trying
to find real love.

1652
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:03,520
So, let's not continue
this drama anymore.

1653
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:05,720
Put an end to this here itself.

1654
01:51:23,880 --> 01:51:26,480
What Mira said is right, isn't it?
- Yes, each and everything.

1655
01:51:28,120 --> 01:51:31,680
Our adamancy and competition
have scarred her mind.

1656
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:33,800
We had the complete
freedom to fight each other

1657
01:51:34,840 --> 01:51:38,000
and then to solve it
by hugging each other.

1658
01:51:38,840 --> 01:51:40,680
Now, Mira is also against us.

1659
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:42,600
One thing is clear.

1660
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:46,640
Mira wanted to accept one of us

1661
01:51:47,080 --> 01:51:48,400
into her life.

1662
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:51,800
It is to identify that person that
Mira had tested us today.

1663
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:54,040
But Mira failed.

1664
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:56,640
With tears of failure in her eyes

1665
01:51:57,280 --> 01:51:58,880
the question which
Mira asked us today

1666
01:51:59,680 --> 01:52:01,840
about the person whom she should
choose to share her life with.

1667
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:05,440
For that question,
we should find an answer today.

1668
01:52:05,960 --> 01:52:09,040
Yes, one of us should back out.

1669
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:13,040
Otherwise, that poor girl will not
be able to bear this anymore.

1670
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:15,720
If one of us decide to back out

1671
01:52:15,920 --> 01:52:17,040
that will be the
answer to Mira's question.

1672
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:19,400
That answer should
be given at the earliest.

1673
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:22,200
Both of us should not lose Mira.

1674
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:24,320
And one of us will have her.

1675
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:27,960
You may decide it, Krishnan.

1676
01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:40,080
We are finding it difficult
to find answers between us.

1677
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:46,920
When I find it difficult to get a
solution for important matters

1678
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:50,080
I usually seek your opinion.

1679
01:52:51,600 --> 01:52:53,200
I will do that now also.

1680
01:52:53,880 --> 01:52:54,720
You may decide, Hari.

1681
01:52:56,880 --> 01:52:58,160
My heart realises that

1682
01:52:58,600 --> 01:53:01,000
you love Mira way more than I do.

1683
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:05,320
Again, you just have to
formally tell me

1684
01:53:06,360 --> 01:53:07,520
that I should quit.

1685
01:53:09,480 --> 01:53:12,840
I am happy to quit for you
with all my heart.

1686
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:16,960
Hari, do you think that I
will say something like that?

1687
01:53:18,200 --> 01:53:19,720
You still don't know me, do you?

1688
01:53:20,280 --> 01:53:22,840
Maybe I will have a lot of pain
while trying to forget Mira.

1689
01:53:23,080 --> 01:53:26,080
But I know that you will suffer
1000 times more pain than I will.

1690
01:53:26,280 --> 01:53:28,480
By knowing that fact,
should I ask you to back out?

1691
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:30,560
Should I?
- Yes, you have to.

1692
01:53:31,720 --> 01:53:33,160
In the core of my heart

1693
01:53:33,720 --> 01:53:35,960
I just have one person
right from the beginning

1694
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:37,920
and that is not
Mira or anyone else.

1695
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:41,160
It is you!
My Krishnan!

1696
01:53:42,680 --> 01:53:44,280
And you are more
important than my life.

1697
01:53:50,280 --> 01:53:52,640
Hari, no.
I will not ask you to back out.

1698
01:53:54,040 --> 01:53:55,080
Only for this issue

1699
01:53:56,080 --> 01:53:58,320
I disagree with your decision.

1700
01:53:59,600 --> 01:54:02,120
Whatever decision we make will be
like forcing Mira to accept it.

1701
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:03,400
That should not happen.

1702
01:54:04,360 --> 01:54:05,880
Let Mira take the decision.

1703
01:54:07,480 --> 01:54:12,240
Let her decide
whenever she feels like it.

1704
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:43,600
"The idol opened its eyes"

1705
01:54:44,040 --> 01:54:48,400
"and the doors opened by itself."

1706
01:54:49,200 --> 01:54:54,280
"The dusk dressed up"

1707
01:54:54,760 --> 01:54:59,240
"as a beautiful bride."

1708
01:55:00,040 --> 01:55:04,800
"Both the sun and the moon
rose up as the grooms."

1709
01:55:05,160 --> 01:55:10,160
"The whole earth stood petrified
at that sight."

1710
01:55:15,640 --> 01:55:20,880
"Whom does the dusk belong to?"

1711
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:25,960
"The sun or the moon?"

1712
01:55:26,240 --> 01:55:31,160
"The idol opened its eyes"

1713
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:35,640
"and the doors opened by itself."

1714
01:55:36,720 --> 01:55:41,800
"The dusk dressed up"

1715
01:55:42,240 --> 01:55:46,800
"as a beautiful bride."

1716
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:29,600
"Oh, dusk! Why are your eyes"

1717
01:56:29,800 --> 01:56:34,760
"filled with tears?"

1718
01:56:35,120 --> 01:56:40,160
"Blessing you with thousands"

1719
01:56:40,440 --> 01:56:45,400
"of bright sun rays."

1720
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:51,080
"The sun descends, making"

1721
01:56:51,160 --> 01:56:56,080
"way for his friend.."

1722
01:56:56,360 --> 01:57:00,520
"For his dear friend."

1723
01:57:01,680 --> 01:57:06,600
"The idol opened its eyes"

1724
01:57:06,920 --> 01:57:11,760
"and the doors opened by itself."

1725
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:17,160
"The dusk dressed up"

1726
01:57:17,640 --> 01:57:22,040
"as a beautiful bride."

1727
01:57:57,280 --> 01:58:02,400
"Along this path,
you will always have"

1728
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:07,640
"shining stars around you."

1729
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:13,080
"To love your actions,
you will always have"

1730
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:18,080
"the clouds to accompany you."

1731
01:58:18,520 --> 01:58:23,320
"Oh, dusk.."

1732
01:58:23,960 --> 01:58:28,760
"Accept the lonely sun"

1733
01:58:29,480 --> 01:58:33,400
"as your partner"

1734
01:58:33,480 --> 01:58:39,360
"and forget this moon forever."

1735
01:58:39,680 --> 01:58:44,840
"The idol opened its eyes"

1736
01:58:44,960 --> 01:58:49,160
"and the doors opened by itself."

1737
01:58:50,160 --> 01:58:55,240
"The dusk dressed up"

1738
01:58:55,680 --> 01:58:59,800
"as a beautiful bride."

1739
01:59:00,920 --> 01:59:05,960
"Both the sun and the moon
rose up as the grooms."

1740
01:59:06,360 --> 01:59:10,960
"The whole earth stood petrified
at that sight."

1741
01:59:11,640 --> 01:59:16,600
"Whom does the dusk belong to?"

1742
01:59:16,920 --> 01:59:21,800
"The sun or the moon?"

1743
01:59:22,120 --> 01:59:27,040
"The idol opened its eyes"

1744
01:59:27,480 --> 01:59:31,560
"and the doors opened by itself."

1745
01:59:32,560 --> 01:59:37,680
"The dusk dressed up"

1746
01:59:38,160 --> 01:59:42,960
"as a beautiful bride."

1747
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:04,760
You guys seem to be
worried about me.

1748
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:08,400
I don't want you guys
to fight over me.

1749
02:00:09,120 --> 02:00:12,040
I'm also not a toy that you guys

1750
02:00:12,160 --> 02:00:14,440
can play around with.

1751
02:00:17,200 --> 02:00:19,960
At some point, both of you started
loving me for no reason.

1752
02:00:20,600 --> 02:00:22,920
Then at some stage,
you say

1753
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:24,800
that neither of you don't want me.

1754
02:00:25,480 --> 02:00:26,920
Why are you guys like this?

1755
02:00:30,240 --> 02:00:33,480
Have I done anything to hurt you
at any point of time?

1756
02:00:34,080 --> 02:00:34,960
Tell me.

1757
02:00:36,040 --> 02:00:39,120
Hari loves Krishnan
and Krishnan loves Hari.

1758
02:00:39,360 --> 02:00:43,280
A third person has no
place in their lives.

1759
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:45,680
I don't want to be
that third person.

1760
02:00:50,640 --> 02:00:53,840
Since we have become so close

1761
02:00:54,320 --> 02:00:58,840
I would like to be your friend.

1762
02:00:59,800 --> 02:01:01,480
Please agree to my request.

1763
02:01:06,200 --> 02:01:10,080
If you find it hard to agree,
it's okay.

1764
02:01:10,320 --> 02:01:13,960
I'm used to living alone
and can continue that way.

1765
02:01:18,760 --> 02:01:21,080
Mira shouldn't be alone in life.

1766
02:01:21,720 --> 02:01:24,560
One of us should be there for her.
- Both of us will be there for her.

1767
02:01:25,320 --> 02:01:29,560
One of us as her friend
the other as her partner.

1768
02:01:44,360 --> 02:01:46,600
You seem to have taken a decision.

1769
02:01:46,720 --> 02:01:49,200
Whom are you going to marry?

1770
02:01:49,360 --> 02:01:53,080
Nobody.
I will be their friend.

1771
02:02:00,080 --> 02:02:04,840
What is the progress? - I found the
whereabouts of the six-member gang.

1772
02:02:04,880 --> 02:02:06,080
Here is the detailed report.

1773
02:02:06,240 --> 02:02:10,320
The Sahyagiri estate barn
is their hideout.

1774
02:02:10,400 --> 02:02:11,440
They are there.

1775
02:02:12,360 --> 02:02:14,200
Mira, before you meet Mohini Varma

1776
02:02:14,680 --> 02:02:16,640
there are certain things
you should know.

1777
02:02:17,080 --> 02:02:20,640
All that glitters beautifully

1778
02:02:20,720 --> 02:02:22,880
might not be gold in reality.

1779
02:02:23,240 --> 02:02:26,040
The Mohini you wanted to meet
for all these years

1780
02:02:26,600 --> 02:02:28,200
was a lie.

1781
02:02:29,800 --> 02:02:31,240
Just like the rainbow.

1782
02:02:34,320 --> 02:02:36,200
Mohini is the person who kindled

1783
02:02:36,320 --> 02:02:39,560
a spectacular
creativity in Guptan.

1784
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:42,960
A phenomenon that seems
true from far away.

1785
02:02:44,080 --> 02:02:47,520
Just like your grandmother
predicted

1786
02:02:48,080 --> 02:02:51,160
you will never meet Mohini Varma.

1787
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:55,600
But you might stumble
upon its origins.

1788
02:02:56,600 --> 02:02:58,920
Anyway, you should accompany us.

1789
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:02,440
We are going to meet
that mysterious woman.

1790
02:03:50,560 --> 02:03:52,640
We are not here to see you.

1791
02:03:52,720 --> 02:03:55,080
We are here to know about Mohini
Varma, who got Guptan killed.

1792
02:03:58,280 --> 02:03:59,480
Where is Mohini?

1793
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:03,280
Where is Mohini?

1794
02:04:03,360 --> 02:04:04,440
Where is Mohini Varma?

1795
02:04:04,960 --> 02:04:07,560
We don't know.
- Oh, you don't?

1796
02:04:07,640 --> 02:04:10,040
Tell us where Mohini is!

1797
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:12,240
Tell me.

1798
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:14,920
Tell me.

1799
02:04:14,960 --> 02:04:16,920
Don't make me beat you.
Tell me.

1800
02:04:16,960 --> 02:04:18,800
Tell me, where is Mohini?

1801
02:04:18,880 --> 02:04:20,280
Tell me, where is Mohini?

1802
02:04:20,680 --> 02:04:25,720
The Mohini you are looking
for is him. Sudarsanan.

1803
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:42,000
So you are going to
tell us what happened.

1804
02:04:42,080 --> 02:04:43,840
No. Don't ask him anything.

1805
02:04:44,040 --> 02:04:45,640
His guilt is driving him crazy.

1806
02:04:45,720 --> 02:04:48,600
We are here to stop him
from killing himself.

1807
02:04:52,040 --> 02:04:55,280
You will feel a lot better
when you talk openly.

1808
02:04:56,080 --> 02:04:58,360
Yes. I will tell you everything.

1809
02:04:58,440 --> 02:04:59,640
There is no other way.

1810
02:05:00,160 --> 02:05:03,560
Nobody killed our beloved
Mr. Guptan.

1811
02:05:04,200 --> 02:05:06,720
He committed suicide
because of me.

1812
02:05:10,240 --> 02:05:13,960
Mr. Guptan was a visiting professor
of philosophy at St. Francis.

1813
02:05:14,600 --> 02:05:16,640
We became close friends quickly.

1814
02:05:17,280 --> 02:05:21,080
He saw life as a beautiful poem.

1815
02:05:24,200 --> 02:05:25,800
When we became closer

1816
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:29,520
we found out that he was planning
to become a saint.

1817
02:05:30,560 --> 02:05:32,520
We felt that such a person
who appreciates beauty

1818
02:05:32,680 --> 02:05:35,880
like him should enter
into wedlock.

1819
02:05:36,120 --> 02:05:39,680
When we went to his house,
his father requested the same.

1820
02:05:40,080 --> 02:05:42,800
We couldn't understand
the woman of his dreams

1821
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,920
even though we tried many times.

1822
02:05:45,960 --> 02:05:49,920
That's when we asked Sudarsanan,
who used to write poems

1823
02:05:49,960 --> 02:05:54,400
to write poems as a lover to know
the feelings of Guptan.

1824
02:05:54,680 --> 02:05:57,160
We heard that he studied
in a college at Indore.

1825
02:05:57,800 --> 02:06:01,960
I created a lover,
who wrote poems for him

1826
02:06:02,240 --> 02:06:04,280
in the backdrop of the
college at Indore.

1827
02:06:04,320 --> 02:06:07,920
Then I transferred her to Delhi.

1828
02:06:08,680 --> 02:06:10,600
I gave her the name Mohini Varma.

1829
02:06:12,680 --> 02:06:16,520
As Mohini Varma,
I wrote him poems in letters.

1830
02:06:16,880 --> 02:06:20,480
He just glanced through
the first few letters.

1831
02:06:21,080 --> 02:06:25,440
But when Sudarsanan started
writing poems, he began to notice.

1832
02:06:26,080 --> 02:06:28,720
He started to admire Mohini.

1833
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:31,080
To awaken the lover in Mr. Guptan.

1834
02:06:31,240 --> 02:06:34,600
And to get him married to a girl
in Mohini's place.

1835
02:06:34,880 --> 02:06:36,520
That's all we wanted to do.

1836
02:06:36,720 --> 02:06:39,960
He not only loved Mohini

1837
02:06:40,400 --> 02:06:43,440
but also wanted to make
her his life partner.

1838
02:06:43,960 --> 02:06:45,600
We were devastated when
we came to know this.

1839
02:06:45,680 --> 02:06:49,160
We wrote a letter inviting him
to Poonoor to know what he felt.

1840
02:06:49,280 --> 02:06:50,720
We never expected him to come.

1841
02:06:51,160 --> 02:06:54,200
All we wanted to do was to beg

1842
02:06:54,280 --> 02:06:57,120
for forgiveness at his feet.

1843
02:06:57,880 --> 02:07:01,560
We told him everything.
What happened next was unexpected.

1844
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:06,280
After hearing all this,
he consoled us.

1845
02:07:06,840 --> 02:07:10,960
He appreciated us for creating
a magical world

1846
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:14,920
of love for a short span
of time for him.

1847
02:07:15,400 --> 02:07:17,440
He blessed me,
touching my forehead.

1848
02:07:19,440 --> 02:07:22,400
When he said goodbye to us

1849
02:07:22,800 --> 02:07:25,400
he said he didn't wish
to come down

1850
02:07:25,880 --> 02:07:29,200
from the imaginary castles
we made for him.

1851
02:07:29,760 --> 02:07:32,640
We didn't know that
those were his last words.

1852
02:07:38,200 --> 02:07:41,000
That night, he injected himself
with poison

1853
02:07:41,320 --> 02:07:44,960
and jumped onto a pickaxe
from the upper story.

1854
02:07:45,040 --> 02:07:46,680
It's all because of me!

1855
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:48,280
It's all because of me!

1856
02:07:48,360 --> 02:07:50,880
It was me!
- Come on. Cheer up.

1857
02:07:51,240 --> 02:07:53,280
Come on. Cheer up.

1858
02:07:54,200 --> 02:07:54,960
Come on.

1859
02:07:58,120 --> 02:08:01,960
Mira, these are magical hands
of Malayalam literature.

1860
02:08:02,960 --> 02:08:06,080
This is the hand that gave birth

1861
02:08:06,440 --> 02:08:08,400
to the poems that you admired.

1862
02:08:12,240 --> 02:08:14,680
Aren't these the hands
that created the beauty

1863
02:08:14,880 --> 02:08:16,200
that Guptan admired so much?

1864
02:08:16,840 --> 02:08:21,240
These are more gifted
than the hands of Mr. Guptan.

1865
02:08:21,560 --> 02:08:23,200
Please don't say that.

1866
02:08:23,960 --> 02:08:27,360
If these hands have anything
special about them

1867
02:08:27,960 --> 02:08:31,640
that is to have had the chance
to touch Mr. Guptan's feet.

1868
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:34,960
Sudarsanan, where is your house?

1869
02:08:39,600 --> 02:08:41,960
He doesn't have a home.
- He is an orphan.

1870
02:08:42,040 --> 02:08:43,880
He grew up in an orphanage.

1871
02:08:46,960 --> 02:08:50,280
You may be an orphan,
but you can't escape

1872
02:08:50,360 --> 02:08:53,800
the responsibility of provoking
Guptan to commit suicide.

1873
02:08:54,600 --> 02:08:56,320
No! I won't deny it!

1874
02:08:56,520 --> 02:08:59,080
I will punish myself
for killing him.

1875
02:08:59,160 --> 02:09:01,880
That is for sure.
- A criminal has no right

1876
02:09:01,960 --> 02:09:03,760
to determine his own punishment.

1877
02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:07,840
According to the whims
of Guptan's father

1878
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:10,760
or as per the court ruling

1879
02:09:11,320 --> 02:09:13,280
you are subject to any punishment,
Sudarsanan.

1880
02:09:13,360 --> 02:09:16,160
What are you saying?
- Sudarsanan, are you ready?

1881
02:09:16,560 --> 02:09:19,520
I'm ready. - Then stay here
until we are back.

1882
02:09:19,880 --> 02:09:21,840
Come.
- Keep an eye on them. - Okay.

1883
02:09:25,240 --> 02:09:26,040
Come.

1884
02:09:27,160 --> 02:09:29,960
No! I won't allow this.

1885
02:09:30,160 --> 02:09:32,040
Those kids have done nothing wrong.

1886
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:34,720
Guptan did not kill himself.

1887
02:09:34,960 --> 02:09:38,000
He never possessed that
poison found in his body.

1888
02:09:40,400 --> 02:09:44,480
Are you trying to make it look
like Guptan committed suicide?

1889
02:09:46,240 --> 02:09:48,360
Guptan didn't commit suicide.

1890
02:09:49,960 --> 02:09:54,520
Yes. We have to make it look like
that to move forward in the case.

1891
02:09:56,960 --> 02:10:00,640
After meeting Sudarsanan
and the others at Poonoor

1892
02:10:01,240 --> 02:10:05,600
Guptan was poisoned
when he returned to his room.

1893
02:10:06,760 --> 02:10:07,720
Who?

1894
02:10:08,960 --> 02:10:11,880
It was Dr. Jaikumar
and his brother Premkumar.

1895
02:10:13,040 --> 02:10:15,160
The children of Ramappan,
Guptan's father's distant relative.

1896
02:10:15,600 --> 02:10:17,320
Brothers who have
a craving for crime.

1897
02:10:17,680 --> 02:10:19,480
Guptan's childhood friends.

1898
02:10:20,480 --> 02:10:22,400
The ones who were supposed
to inherit Guptan's property

1899
02:10:22,880 --> 02:10:25,840
after he becomes a saint.

1900
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:30,480
They made liabilities worth crores
with that line of thinking.

1901
02:10:31,360 --> 02:10:34,040
When they got to know that Guptan
was about to marry Mohini Varma

1902
02:10:34,120 --> 02:10:39,280
they lost their peace of mind.

1903
02:10:39,800 --> 02:10:41,720
There shouldn't be anybody else
to inherit the property.

1904
02:10:41,840 --> 02:10:46,200
When Guptan went to Poonoor
to pick up Mohini Varma

1905
02:10:46,640 --> 02:10:50,480
they poisoned him
in his hotel room.

1906
02:10:51,080 --> 02:10:51,960
That is the truth.

1907
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
But that is not what the court
wants to hear.

1908
02:10:54,120 --> 02:10:55,040
The court wants evidence.

1909
02:10:55,520 --> 02:10:59,480
Evidence is what
they have not left behind.

1910
02:11:00,600 --> 02:11:02,280
Does that mean
we cannot apprehend them?

1911
02:11:04,560 --> 02:11:05,440
No, we cannot.

1912
02:11:06,040 --> 02:11:07,440
This could be the first case

1913
02:11:07,520 --> 02:11:09,880
where Harikrishnans
are helpless.

1914
02:11:12,080 --> 02:11:14,400
The poison and the syringe
used to kill him

1915
02:11:15,080 --> 02:11:19,120
was a mysterious compound created
by the brilliant Dr. Jaikumar.

1916
02:11:19,840 --> 02:11:21,400
A secret concoction
of various chemicals

1917
02:11:21,640 --> 02:11:25,120
that cannot be detected
by any lab.

1918
02:11:27,160 --> 02:11:29,360
That concoction
is the only evidence we have

1919
02:11:29,520 --> 02:11:31,240
against them.

1920
02:11:32,240 --> 02:11:34,600
Until we receive any information
about that concoction

1921
02:11:35,400 --> 02:11:37,920
no matter how hard
we fight against them

1922
02:11:38,760 --> 02:11:40,720
no court will not be able
to punish them.

1923
02:11:44,320 --> 02:11:47,320
We might just have
to watch the court

1924
02:11:48,520 --> 02:11:49,400
setting them free.

1925
02:11:50,320 --> 02:11:51,480
What do we do now?

1926
02:11:51,960 --> 02:11:54,160
Yes, there is one way.

1927
02:11:54,200 --> 02:11:55,240
Just one way.

1928
02:11:55,840 --> 02:11:58,200
There should be another situation
such as the one

1929
02:11:58,280 --> 02:11:59,200
when Guptan was murdered.

1930
02:11:59,880 --> 02:12:02,240
The criminals should be forced
to repeat their crime.

1931
02:12:02,520 --> 02:12:05,560
They have to prepare
that deadly concoction again.

1932
02:12:05,840 --> 02:12:08,080
We have to apprehend them
along with that poison.

1933
02:12:08,560 --> 02:12:09,640
So?

1934
02:12:10,120 --> 02:12:11,400
We will have to bring Guptan
back to life.

1935
02:12:12,120 --> 02:12:13,120
How?

1936
02:12:14,400 --> 02:12:17,280
This plan only has a very
small chance of success.

1937
02:12:19,120 --> 02:12:20,160
Let us see how that turns out.

1938
02:12:20,760 --> 02:12:24,200
We might have to wait for years
to catch the criminals.

1939
02:12:24,920 --> 02:12:28,040
Then we might have
to close this case

1940
02:12:28,520 --> 02:12:29,920
considering the incident
to be a suicide.

1941
02:12:31,120 --> 02:12:32,280
Don't ask us any more questions.

1942
02:12:34,960 --> 02:12:36,760
You have to be at the palace
tomorrow morning.

1943
02:12:37,040 --> 02:12:38,360
I am going to inform the Lord
about it.

1944
02:12:38,680 --> 02:12:39,680
No, I will go.

1945
02:12:40,080 --> 02:12:41,320
You both be there in the morning.

1946
02:12:45,800 --> 02:12:47,800
Those boys shouldn't know about
whatever we spoke here.

1947
02:12:48,600 --> 02:12:50,280
We won't know what
they could do

1948
02:12:50,360 --> 02:12:51,880
once they get to know
about Guptan's killers.

1949
02:12:53,280 --> 02:12:54,160
Come.

1950
02:12:59,480 --> 02:13:02,560
All of you will stay
with us tonight.

1951
02:13:05,320 --> 02:13:09,200
Tomorrow, it is the tenth day
of the festival at the palace.

1952
02:13:09,640 --> 02:13:13,640
I gave Guptan's dad my word
that I would apprehend

1953
02:13:13,920 --> 02:13:15,280
the criminals on that day.

1954
02:13:16,440 --> 02:13:18,720
We will all be going to the palace
tomorrow morning.

1955
02:13:19,160 --> 02:13:19,960
Are you ready for that?

1956
02:13:20,120 --> 02:13:20,920
Yes, we are.

1957
02:13:43,640 --> 02:13:44,920
I have been waiting.

1958
02:13:45,320 --> 02:13:47,040
You don't have to introduce
yourselves.

1959
02:13:47,200 --> 02:13:48,680
He explained everything to me.

1960
02:13:49,160 --> 02:13:50,920
Harikrishnans kept their word.

1961
02:13:51,480 --> 02:13:54,080
Well, who among you is Sudarsanan?

1962
02:13:55,680 --> 02:13:57,080
Whatever happened was fate.

1963
02:13:57,520 --> 02:14:01,280
He was destined to die
at the age of 33.

1964
02:14:01,720 --> 02:14:06,320
Let me see the boy that made him
make such a move.

1965
02:14:08,560 --> 02:14:10,640
This is Sudarsanan.

1966
02:14:17,560 --> 02:14:19,040
What was all this for?

1967
02:14:19,840 --> 02:14:22,720
Why did you play such games
with my innocent child?

1968
02:14:24,280 --> 02:14:27,200
What had he done to you
that you made him force himself

1969
02:14:27,240 --> 02:14:28,960
to commit suicide?

1970
02:14:29,200 --> 02:14:30,080
Tell me.

1971
02:14:31,520 --> 02:14:34,560
Why did you kill the only person
who was supposed to perform

1972
02:14:34,640 --> 02:14:36,960
the rituals after my demise?

1973
02:14:37,280 --> 02:14:38,120
Just tell me.

1974
02:14:38,600 --> 02:14:43,280
The court can punish him
for forcing him

1975
02:14:43,480 --> 02:14:45,960
to commit suicide.
- No.

1976
02:14:46,280 --> 02:14:47,560
I don't want the court
to punish them.

1977
02:14:47,880 --> 02:14:49,840
He deserves a punishment
that comes from the heart

1978
02:14:49,920 --> 02:14:53,720
of a father that lost
his only son.

1979
02:14:54,160 --> 02:14:55,240
Do you agree?

1980
02:14:56,280 --> 02:14:57,200
Yes, I do.

1981
02:14:57,840 --> 02:14:59,480
Then I have decided
the punishment.

1982
02:14:59,880 --> 02:15:01,560
For making me lose my son

1983
02:15:01,840 --> 02:15:06,120
he will have to stay here
and look after me and the house

1984
02:15:06,280 --> 02:15:07,200
all his life.

1985
02:15:14,840 --> 02:15:18,600
But don't think that you will get
any bit of our property.

1986
02:15:19,480 --> 02:15:21,400
I have decided what to do
with the property.

1987
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:27,280
I won't be able to experience
the sight of the Goddess

1988
02:15:27,920 --> 02:15:32,760
appearing in front of us
on hearing Guptan's music

1989
02:15:33,200 --> 02:15:34,640
ever again.

1990
02:15:36,360 --> 02:15:39,560
So, I have decided to donate
all my wealth

1991
02:15:40,080 --> 02:15:44,960
to the temple's trust.

1992
02:15:47,520 --> 02:15:50,480
Along with witnessing the Goddess

1993
02:15:50,880 --> 02:15:52,880
there will be many documents
signed tonight.

1994
02:15:55,080 --> 02:15:58,520
We shall then survive,
surviving on the temple offerings

1995
02:15:59,040 --> 02:16:01,080
and live here for all our lives.

1996
02:16:01,720 --> 02:16:02,640
This is my decision.

1997
02:16:03,480 --> 02:16:04,960
Did everybody get that?

1998
02:16:06,920 --> 02:16:08,360
Go to the temple and make
all the arrangements. - Okay.

1999
02:16:14,400 --> 02:16:15,280
One moment.

2000
02:16:15,640 --> 02:16:16,560
Mira.

2001
02:16:20,800 --> 02:16:23,960
This is Dr. Jaikumar
and Mr. Premkumar.

2002
02:16:24,120 --> 02:16:25,160
They are Guptan's cousins.

2003
02:16:25,520 --> 02:16:27,200
She is Mira.
She is Guptan's friend.

2004
02:16:27,440 --> 02:16:28,480
Hello.

2005
02:16:37,800 --> 02:16:40,160
Mira..
- What happened, Mira?

2006
02:16:43,960 --> 02:16:45,520
When they stood in front of me..

2007
02:16:45,960 --> 02:16:47,400
Calm down..

2008
02:16:48,040 --> 02:16:48,880
Come.

2009
02:16:49,040 --> 02:16:52,040
When I got to know
that Harikrishnans have got

2010
02:16:52,080 --> 02:16:53,120
the case,
I was so worried.

2011
02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:55,360
But I just got to know
that they are just fools.

2012
02:16:55,640 --> 02:16:59,120
Wait, don't just consider
the Harikrishnans to be fools.

2013
02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:04,080
They might not seem like much,
but they are devious and crafty.

2014
02:17:04,640 --> 02:17:09,400
They may strike out of nowhere.
We have to be very careful.

2015
02:17:09,880 --> 02:17:12,280
What can they do now?
What should we be afraid of?

2016
02:17:12,560 --> 02:17:14,920
I am not asking you to be afraid.
Think about it.

2017
02:17:15,240 --> 02:17:17,520
We have two targets
in front of us now.

2018
02:17:17,800 --> 02:17:22,280
One is that boy whom
they have given shelter here.

2019
02:17:22,560 --> 02:17:24,800
They have given birth
to another Guptan.

2020
02:17:25,320 --> 02:17:26,880
We shouldn't fall for that bait.

2021
02:17:27,320 --> 02:17:30,760
The second is the event
where the entire property

2022
02:17:30,840 --> 02:17:34,480
will be handed over
to the temple trust.

2023
02:17:35,280 --> 02:17:37,160
Don't you see a trap in that?

2024
02:17:38,280 --> 02:17:41,640
You have to watch out
for such traps.

2025
02:17:42,320 --> 02:17:43,520
It should not happen.

2026
02:17:44,120 --> 02:17:47,240
There is no need to prepare
a detailed will.

2027
02:17:47,680 --> 02:17:50,160
With the new will, the old ones
become obsolete.

2028
02:17:52,080 --> 02:17:54,080
We have an important message
from Chennai.

2029
02:17:54,480 --> 02:17:58,040
The board meeting
has been scheduled for tomorrow.

2030
02:17:58,960 --> 02:18:01,120
Premkumar and I have to travel
to Chennai as soon as possible.

2031
02:18:01,560 --> 02:18:02,880
What are you saying?

2032
02:18:03,200 --> 02:18:05,480
Nowadays, there is no one
to manage the affairs here.

2033
02:18:05,800 --> 02:18:07,560
Who will make the arrangements
for the function?

2034
02:18:07,640 --> 02:18:09,040
It was unexpected.

2035
02:18:09,640 --> 02:18:10,800
We cannot miss it.

2036
02:18:11,040 --> 02:18:12,200
The train leaves at 7 o'clock
tonight.

2037
02:18:12,440 --> 02:18:14,800
What is the point in stopping you
if the work is that important?

2038
02:18:15,160 --> 02:18:16,600
Go ahead.
What else can I say?

2039
02:18:25,680 --> 02:18:26,920
Where are you going
with your luggage?

2040
02:18:28,080 --> 02:18:30,320
We received an unexpected mail.

2041
02:18:30,520 --> 02:18:32,280
We are heading to Chennai.

2042
02:18:34,680 --> 02:18:35,560
This is bad.

2043
02:18:35,640 --> 02:18:37,680
The Lord was happy, thinking
everybody would be here at home.

2044
02:18:37,760 --> 02:18:39,480
How can we go there
and tell him that we are going?

2045
02:18:40,880 --> 02:18:42,600
So, are you leaving too?

2046
02:18:42,960 --> 02:18:43,880
Yes.
- Yes.

2047
02:18:44,640 --> 02:18:46,120
They have hundreds
of pending cases.

2048
02:18:46,360 --> 02:18:48,480
Why get stuck here?
Let them go.

2049
02:18:48,600 --> 02:18:49,680
Go..

2050
02:19:09,920 --> 02:19:11,840
Did you write this song,
Sudarsanan?

2051
02:19:12,280 --> 02:19:13,160
Yes.

2052
02:19:13,640 --> 02:19:15,360
Guptan used to like this
a lot.

2053
02:19:16,400 --> 02:19:18,560
Guptan had kept it safe
behind this Veena

2054
02:19:18,920 --> 02:19:21,440
and had plans to play
that song tonight.

2055
02:19:21,680 --> 02:19:26,240
There used to be a function here
until last year

2056
02:19:26,600 --> 02:19:30,840
where the Goddess would appear

2057
02:19:30,920 --> 02:19:31,840
and bless them all.

2058
02:19:32,440 --> 02:19:33,640
That function cannot
be cancelled this year.

2059
02:19:34,360 --> 02:19:36,480
You will sing this song
that you had written

2060
02:19:37,040 --> 02:19:39,840
at this palace tonight
with a prayerful mind.

2061
02:19:40,640 --> 02:19:43,520
The divine Goddess should appear
in front of us here.

2062
02:19:44,440 --> 02:19:49,200
You must possess the belief
and trust for that to happen.

2063
02:19:49,360 --> 02:19:50,240
You have it.

2064
02:19:50,720 --> 02:19:53,600
All of you must be there
to help Sudarsanan.

2065
02:19:55,680 --> 02:19:58,880
We ended up liking Guptan,
though not as much as you.

2066
02:19:59,080 --> 02:20:01,880
His poor father is like
a father figure to us now.

2067
02:20:03,800 --> 02:20:05,080
If you've done wrong

2068
02:20:05,280 --> 02:20:07,400
to that father and his son

2069
02:20:07,920 --> 02:20:09,160
this is your chance to correct it.

2070
02:20:10,320 --> 02:20:11,200
Don't waste it.

2071
02:20:11,760 --> 02:20:13,520
No. Sudarsanan will sing.

2072
02:20:13,920 --> 02:20:14,760
I've got this.

2073
02:20:15,160 --> 02:20:15,960
Come.

2074
02:20:24,800 --> 02:20:26,160
The train will arrive
in 30 minutes.

2075
02:20:26,440 --> 02:20:27,240
Make no mistakes.

2076
02:20:27,320 --> 02:20:29,480
One of you is Dr. Jaikumar,
and the other is Premkumar

2077
02:20:29,560 --> 02:20:31,120
travelling to Chennai
with these tickets.

2078
02:20:31,360 --> 02:20:32,520
Raise no suspicions.

2079
02:20:32,600 --> 02:20:33,960
Be careful.

2080
02:20:34,280 --> 02:20:35,120
Hurry up!

2081
02:21:19,760 --> 02:21:22,080
"An evening so rare"

2082
02:21:22,240 --> 02:21:24,560
"filled with heavenly music."

2083
02:21:24,920 --> 02:21:27,040
"The tunes so mystical"

2084
02:21:27,560 --> 02:21:30,000
"are filling our hearts."

2085
02:21:30,520 --> 02:21:32,760
"Within my heart"

2086
02:21:33,040 --> 02:21:34,920
"are your divine words."

2087
02:21:35,200 --> 02:21:40,200
"Oh, Goddess! This life
has fulfilled its purpose."

2088
02:21:40,240 --> 02:21:42,400
"An evening so rare"

2089
02:21:42,800 --> 02:21:45,040
"filled with heavenly music."

2090
02:21:45,400 --> 02:21:47,600
"The tunes so mystical"

2091
02:21:48,080 --> 02:21:50,440
"are filling our hearts."

2092
02:22:16,080 --> 02:22:18,720
"Your face,
so elegant and graceful"

2093
02:22:19,120 --> 02:22:21,360
"resembles the mystical chants
at dawn."

2094
02:22:21,720 --> 02:22:25,960
"Your divinity is as vast
as the seven seas."

2095
02:22:26,640 --> 02:22:29,320
"Your face,
so elegant and graceful"

2096
02:22:29,680 --> 02:22:31,880
"resembles the mystical chants
at dawn."

2097
02:22:32,240 --> 02:22:36,560
"Your divinity is as vast
as the seven seas."

2098
02:22:37,440 --> 02:22:39,360
"Oh, ever-beautiful one!"

2099
02:22:40,080 --> 02:22:41,960
"Thy charms are boundless!"

2100
02:22:42,600 --> 02:22:46,600
"Synched into life
are your footsteps."

2101
02:22:50,240 --> 02:22:51,680
"Music is the meditation."

2102
02:22:52,800 --> 02:22:54,400
"The song is the path."

2103
02:22:55,480 --> 02:22:57,880
"Music is the meditation.
The song is the path."

2104
02:22:58,040 --> 02:22:59,200
"Your presence is its purpose."

2105
02:22:59,400 --> 02:23:03,160
"Spreads a silence,
the oldest form of sound."

2106
02:23:05,880 --> 02:23:08,200
"An evening so rare"

2107
02:23:08,600 --> 02:23:10,720
"filled with heavenly music."

2108
02:23:10,960 --> 02:23:13,360
"The tunes so mystical"

2109
02:23:13,600 --> 02:23:16,200
"are filling our hearts."

2110
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:25,160
My Lord! My Lord..

2111
02:23:25,360 --> 02:23:27,960
The Goddess is ready
at the temple gates!

2112
02:23:31,080 --> 02:23:32,320
They will arrive shortly.

2113
02:23:36,640 --> 02:23:38,920
Sing! Don't stop! Sing..

2114
02:23:52,680 --> 02:23:53,800
Ask him to sing.

2115
02:23:54,120 --> 02:23:54,920
Sing.

2116
02:23:56,840 --> 02:23:59,320
Sing. - Sing, man.
- Sing!

2117
02:24:04,120 --> 02:24:08,240
What is this? Sing!
Sing!

2118
02:24:20,680 --> 02:24:25,840
"Now, the tears shall turn
to tender flowers."

2119
02:24:26,200 --> 02:24:30,560
"The sorrows will turn
into a state of bliss."

2120
02:24:31,080 --> 02:24:36,240
"Now the tears shall turn
to tender flowers."

2121
02:24:36,320 --> 02:24:40,960
"The sorrows will turn
into a state of bliss."

2122
02:24:41,520 --> 02:24:46,400
"The darkness of sins
shall dissolve in rays of hope."

2123
02:24:46,600 --> 02:24:50,960
"All the good deeds
shall be rewarded."

2124
02:24:51,760 --> 02:24:56,480
"Even when helpless,
the divinity within you.."

2125
02:24:56,680 --> 02:25:01,600
"Even when helpless,
the divinity within you.."

2126
02:25:02,080 --> 02:25:06,640
"...will always give you strength."

2127
02:25:06,880 --> 02:25:11,440
"Now, the tears shall turn
to tender flowers."

2128
02:25:22,160 --> 02:25:23,560
"Music is the meditation.
- Music is the meditation."

2129
02:25:24,760 --> 02:25:26,080
"The song is the path.
- The song is the path."

2130
02:25:27,320 --> 02:25:29,720
"Music is the meditation.
The song is the path."

2131
02:25:29,880 --> 02:25:32,400
"Your presence is its purpose.
- Your presence is its purpose."

2132
02:25:32,520 --> 02:25:34,840
"Spreads a silence,
the oldest form of sound."

2133
02:25:57,960 --> 02:26:00,240
"An evening so rare"

2134
02:26:00,720 --> 02:26:02,880
"filled with heavenly music."

2135
02:26:03,200 --> 02:26:05,400
"The tunes so mystical"

2136
02:26:05,760 --> 02:26:08,360
"are filling our hearts."

2137
02:26:08,840 --> 02:26:13,280
"Within my heart
are your divine words."

2138
02:26:13,520 --> 02:26:18,480
"Oh, Goddess! This life
has fulfilled its purpose."

2139
02:26:18,520 --> 02:26:20,840
"An evening so rare"

2140
02:26:21,120 --> 02:26:23,400
"filled with heavenly music."

2141
02:26:23,760 --> 02:26:25,960
"The tunes so mystical"

2142
02:26:26,320 --> 02:26:28,960
"are filling our hearts."

2143
02:26:51,960 --> 02:26:52,880
Come!

2144
02:26:59,960 --> 02:27:01,800
Wait here. Come.

2145
02:27:02,080 --> 02:27:02,880
Come on.

2146
02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:33,000
Freshen up and come soon.

2147
02:28:31,080 --> 02:28:32,400
Ew!

2148
02:28:40,080 --> 02:28:40,880
Thanks.

2149
02:28:42,280 --> 02:28:45,400
I'll take the evidence now.

2150
02:28:57,320 --> 02:28:59,720
Jai! Prem!

2151
02:29:00,640 --> 02:29:03,040
You, whom I raised like Guptan..

2152
02:29:03,480 --> 02:29:06,200
Please don't..
An apology..

2153
02:29:08,960 --> 02:29:09,760
You!

2154
02:29:59,320 --> 02:30:01,080
Come.
You have a chance for payback.

2155
02:30:01,200 --> 02:30:02,880
Let's go.
They'll be right back. Come.

2156
02:30:19,920 --> 02:30:20,760
Oh, no!

2157
02:30:57,560 --> 02:31:01,160
Enough.. You guys go back. You're
needed there. Leave.. Come on.

2158
02:31:02,600 --> 02:31:04,760
Where were you?
Stay here. Come here.

2159
02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:28,720
Tell me!
How do I thank you?

2160
02:32:29,200 --> 02:32:31,040
It's we who are grateful to you

2161
02:32:31,280 --> 02:32:33,520
because you did exactly
what we told you.

2162
02:32:33,760 --> 02:32:35,240
It's all down
to the Goddess' blessings!

2163
02:32:35,480 --> 02:32:37,840
It was extremely difficult
for me to control myself

2164
02:32:37,920 --> 02:32:40,640
every time I saw
Guptan's murderers.

2165
02:32:41,520 --> 02:32:43,640
Where are they?
- They are standing outside.

2166
02:32:43,760 --> 02:32:45,040
The cops have arrested them.
Do you want to see them?

2167
02:32:45,160 --> 02:32:47,400
No. Ramappan and his sons!

2168
02:32:47,480 --> 02:32:49,560
I don't want to see
those sinners anymore!

2169
02:32:49,720 --> 02:32:52,440
I'll lose all the serenity
that I feel in this holy moment.

2170
02:32:53,440 --> 02:32:56,760
I won't find it tough
to forget it all now

2171
02:32:57,640 --> 02:32:58,680
as he is here.

2172
02:33:00,680 --> 02:33:03,640
He is the sole heir
to Killikal palace.

2173
02:33:05,120 --> 02:33:06,560
I consider you just
like my dear Guptan!

2174
02:33:14,640 --> 02:33:16,400
As you had promised me

2175
02:33:16,720 --> 02:33:19,520
you identified Guptan's murderers
and brought them to me.

2176
02:33:19,680 --> 02:33:21,680
You brought Guptan
back to me as well.

2177
02:33:22,040 --> 02:33:24,480
Let me thank..

2178
02:33:24,600 --> 02:33:26,400
No, my Lord!
Please don't.

2179
02:33:26,840 --> 02:33:30,280
We consider ourselves
blessed and fortunate

2180
02:33:30,680 --> 02:33:32,760
to stand before you right now.

2181
02:33:33,240 --> 02:33:36,960
We consider your happiness
as the ultimate treasure!

2182
02:33:37,240 --> 02:33:39,280
Then again, shall
we request you something?

2183
02:33:39,440 --> 02:33:40,240
Please tell me what it is.

2184
02:33:40,840 --> 02:33:42,720
The two of us wish to sleep

2185
02:33:42,800 --> 02:33:46,680
in the room which
used to be Guptan's.

2186
02:33:46,960 --> 02:33:50,200
Will you please let us do it?
- Is that even a question?

2187
02:33:51,200 --> 02:33:54,720
I want all of you to stay here not
for a day, but for a whole month.

2188
02:33:54,800 --> 02:33:56,320
What do you say?
- We're ready.

2189
02:33:56,360 --> 02:33:58,760
Me, too! - Okay!
- But I need to leave.

2190
02:33:58,880 --> 02:34:01,320
My daughter and son-in-law are
coming from Singapore in two days.

2191
02:34:01,400 --> 02:34:03,400
Four months pregnant.. - Is it
your son-in-law who is pregnant?

2192
02:34:04,440 --> 02:34:05,760
Stop kidding!

2193
02:34:05,840 --> 02:34:07,560
Don't ruin this occasion
with your silly jokes.

2194
02:34:07,640 --> 02:34:10,240
I know the two of you love
to crack jokes! I know that..

2195
02:34:10,960 --> 02:34:11,920
We have to leave tomorrow.

2196
02:34:12,480 --> 02:34:14,560
We have another case that needs
to be settled immediately.

2197
02:34:14,800 --> 02:34:15,600
It's between us.

2198
02:34:18,320 --> 02:34:19,280
It's a difference of opinion.

2199
02:34:19,320 --> 02:34:21,600
Bless us to find
the ideal solution to it.

2200
02:34:22,280 --> 02:34:25,200
My prayers and blessings
will always be with you.

2201
02:34:25,880 --> 02:34:27,400
May the Lord bless you!

2202
02:34:27,440 --> 02:34:29,960
We shall take your leave then.
- Okay. - See you. - Bye.

2203
02:34:31,560 --> 02:34:33,160
I'll see you in the morning
before we leave.

2204
02:34:34,960 --> 02:34:35,800
See you.

2205
02:34:41,600 --> 02:34:42,400
See you.

2206
02:34:53,720 --> 02:34:55,040
Where are they?

2207
02:34:55,360 --> 02:34:56,240
They went to settle
the unfinished case

2208
02:34:56,440 --> 02:34:58,240
they had mentioned yesterday.
They will be here soon.

2209
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:05,960
You said that you wanted to remain
as our friend, didn't you?

2210
02:35:06,760 --> 02:35:08,560
We are ready
to meet you halfway.

2211
02:35:09,760 --> 02:35:11,800
What does that mean?
- We agree

2212
02:35:11,840 --> 02:35:14,520
that one of us will
always be your friend.

2213
02:35:15,040 --> 02:35:16,560
You should
choose who that person is.

2214
02:35:16,840 --> 02:35:18,160
Right now and right here.

2215
02:35:18,240 --> 02:35:19,080
And then?

2216
02:35:20,040 --> 02:35:21,560
He'll have the right to decide

2217
02:35:21,600 --> 02:35:25,840
who'll be your better half.

2218
02:35:26,360 --> 02:35:27,760
I see.

2219
02:35:28,560 --> 02:35:30,680
Tell us.
Is it me or Krishnan?

2220
02:35:31,360 --> 02:35:32,520
Whom do you choose
as your friend?

2221
02:35:34,360 --> 02:35:37,320
Come on. Is it me or Hari?
Who is it going to be?

2222
02:35:38,280 --> 02:35:42,000
You've no plans
to let me be, do you? - No.

2223
02:35:43,080 --> 02:35:45,680
Okay. In that case, I need some
time to think about it.

2224
02:35:46,080 --> 02:35:47,080
Why do you need time?

2225
02:35:47,360 --> 02:35:49,320
We just asked
you to choose a friend.

2226
02:35:49,800 --> 02:35:53,240
The decision I make now
should be one that I won't

2227
02:35:53,480 --> 02:35:54,800
regret ever in my life.

2228
02:35:54,880 --> 02:35:55,720
That's fair enough.

2229
02:35:56,440 --> 02:35:58,080
How much time do you need?

2230
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:00,640
At least ten days.

2231
02:36:01,680 --> 02:36:02,480
Okay.

2232
02:36:02,920 --> 02:36:04,960
We'll be on our way then.
See you.

2233
02:36:21,040 --> 02:36:23,960
No goodbyes because
we'll certainly meet again!

2234
02:36:24,040 --> 02:36:27,200
No goodbyes since it is quite
possible that we'll meet again.

2235
02:36:27,240 --> 02:36:28,160
When my daughter and son-in-law

2236
02:36:28,200 --> 02:36:31,280
come from Singapore..
- Shut up! - Get in.. - Shut up!

2237
02:36:56,800 --> 02:36:59,120
'Hari. Krishnan.'

2238
02:37:05,840 --> 02:37:08,240
Help me choose a friend.
A friend.

2239
02:37:08,640 --> 02:37:09,840
Who should I choose as my friend?

2240
02:37:17,520 --> 02:37:20,720
'Mira chose
the one who should be her friend'

2241
02:37:20,800 --> 02:37:23,520
'and he chose her better half.'

2242
02:37:23,880 --> 02:37:29,920
"The full moon welcomes you."

2243
02:37:30,440 --> 02:37:36,680
"The nightly birds sing
about your footsteps."

2244
02:37:37,040 --> 02:37:43,640
"My mind awaits your consent."

2245
02:37:43,680 --> 02:37:50,240
"I await your arrival."

2246
02:37:50,360 --> 02:37:56,800
"Won't you come,
beautiful eloquence?"

2247
02:37:57,120 --> 02:38:03,560
"I stay silent in the dark night
as the moonlight."

2248
02:38:03,760 --> 02:38:07,080
"Don't you remember
our first meeting"

2249
02:38:07,200 --> 02:38:10,360
"by the stream where
the water lilies grow?"
